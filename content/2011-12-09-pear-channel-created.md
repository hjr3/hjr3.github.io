I finally got around to creating my own PEAR channel. I am hosting it on github using <a title="The simple PEAR Channel Server Manager " href="http://pirum.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Pirum</a> to manage the channel. The channel is located at <a title="hradtke PEAR channel" href="http://hradtke.github.com/pear/" target="_blank">http://hradtke.github.com/pear/</a>. So far I have a single package in then channel: <a title="gearboot PEAR download link" href="http://hradtke.github.com/pear/get/gearboot-1.0.0.tgz" target="_blank">gearboot</a>. I will be writing more about gearboot shortly.
