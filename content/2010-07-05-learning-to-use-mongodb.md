I have heard of <a class="zem_slink" title="MongoDB" rel="homepage" href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a> for some time and have read quite a few articles and attended some conference seminars about it.  I had put off using MongoDB because I could find no project that really made good use of it.  About two weeks ago I started a project that doesn't really fit into the <a class="zem_slink" title="Relational database" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a> mold.  I finally had the perfect excuse to devote the time and effort to learning all about MongoDB and take my place among the ranks of developers using <a class="zem_slink" title="NoSQL" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> (whatever that means).

The packages provided by <a title="10gen" rel="homepage" href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a> were easy to find and there  were no  problems installing them on my <a title="Ubuntu (operating system)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> laptop.  Rather than searching the web for introductions to MongoDB, I decided to learn it from <a class="zem_slink" title="10gen" rel="homepage" href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a> (the company who developed MongoDB).  I purchased the rough cut of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449389536/" target="_blank">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide from O'Reilly Safari</a>.  This was the first time I have purchased a rough cut book and so far I have no complaints.  I opted for the e-book version so I could get up a running right away (I am also running out of bookshelf space).  I am 3 chapters in and so far I have no complaints.  I am concerned that the ubiquitous use of documents may cause a square peg/round hole issue, but so far I have no run into any problems.  The use of a <a class="zem_slink" title="JSON" rel="homepage" href="http://json.org">JSON</a> super-set makes the syntax feel very natural to me and is a huge plus in my opinion.

I will post my thoughts and experiences here as the project progresses and I learn more about MongoDB.  I love learning new things and so far MongoDB has not disappointed.
