I have added a PHP 5.3 branch to the Crimson framework.  The code now uses namespaces and has a native namespace autoloader.  Some of the classes were renamed to conform with the PHP Framework Standards Group preliminary standard.

For the time being I will be keeping a 5.2 and 5.3 version of the Crimson framework until PHP 5.3 becomes even more stable.
