I am a sociologist turned full stack engineer with 13+ years of professional software development and 5+ years of engineering management experience. I was an early employee at HauteLook where I designed and built most of the original API that powered the HauteLook (and later Nordstromrack.com) website and mobile applications. Later, I became the VP of Engineering at Nordstromrack.com | HauteLook where I managed a Technology department of 150 people. I spent a past life writing a lot of PHP and C and used that knowledge to help maintain the <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/memcache">pecl/memcache</a> and <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/gearman">pecl/gearman</a> extensions. Currently, I am a Rust enthusiast, but primarily use web languages for my job.<br>

Outside of technology, I enjoy homebrewing, hiking, camping and reading.


I also organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rust-Los-Angeles/">Rust Los Angeles Meetup</a>. Come join us if you are in the LA area and want to meet other people who are using Rust.
