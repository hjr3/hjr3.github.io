The drawback to these shortcuts is that many developers don't learn how to cope in other database environments, like PostgreSQL.  Take INSERT IGNORE for example:  PostgreSQL does not have support for this syntax.  A resourceful developer can do a quick google search to learn an alternative, but many of the solutions at the top of google will show the wrong way to solve this problem.\n\nCommon bad example 1: Use a SELECT statement to check if the key exists and INSERT only if the key is not found.\nThe main problem with this solution is the glaring race condition.  In the time in between the SELECT and INSERT, another session can insert the record.  You also have to write extra code into your application to process the SELECT query, which may have to specific for many cases.  A big waste of time.\nCommon bad example 2: Delete the row containing the key to be inserted and then INSERT the data again.\nHopefully this is done in a transaction, but it still is dicey.  While this solution requires no extra application code to be written, it will only work for very basic cases.  Timestamps, flags and other meta data will be lost with a blind delete.  This solution scares me the most.\nBoth examples 1 and 2 can also be made into stored procedures.  Don't be tricked into thinking this is a better solution.\nThe best solution is to insert the data and, if there is an error, check the error code.

These services use the same core libraries our legacy C application uses.  Keeping all this business logic in a central place makes life much easier, but the way services are written is horribly inefficient.  I am on a mission to find a better way.\n\nAll our services communicate using XML with the same basic structure.  Without going into too much detail, there is a single complex tag which contains data specific to that request.  The problem with the way we do services is that each service is responsible for parsing a unique set of XML.  We have over 50,000 lines of service code dedicated to parsing XML.  Maintenance is problematic and making changes to services is often hindered by changes to the client(s), the XML and the service parsing code.  Thankfully many of our existing services are becoming obsolete.  However, we are at a pivotal point where there is a need for a new set of services.  A perfect time to make some changes.\nAt work there are a number of finance calculations written in C for the legacy application.  As we migrate more and more of the application onto the web, one of the biggest questions is what to do with these calculations.  The current service framework we use has proven too difficult to maintain and re-writing all the calculations in php is an inefficient use of our time and may be too slow.\nI had come across Thrift some time ago, but rejected it as it was still pretty new.  Now that it resides in Apache's incubator, I felt it was worth checking out as an alternative to the existing way we do services.  One of the first things I noticed was that Thrift's PHP tutorial seemed to be incomplete.  So I decided to create a small example program to demo Thrift to my co-workers.\nThrift's code generation speaks for itself.  But, how fast is it?  I decided to run a quick comparison between raw php and thrift.  I implemented a basic APR calculation in php\n\nFor a good general case, I used the FDIC's example numbers.  The php code performed pretty well.\n\nResult:\nreal    0m0.017s\nuser    0m0.012s\nsys     0m0.005s\nHowever, I wanted something that took more processing power to compute.  So I plugged in some numbers to simulate a worst case scenario.  As you can see, the amount of iterations required to calculate this result was costly.\n\nResult:\nreal    0m0.442s\nuser    0m0.439s\nsys     0m0.003s\nNow it is time to build a thrift service.  There is no C support for thrift, so I chose C++ for the server and php for the client.  I created a simple thrift file that defines a simple deal object and a Sale service with a lonely calc_apr method.\n\nAfter using the thrift utility to build my C++ and php files, I had to fill in the C++ skeleton with some actual logic.  The function below is pretty much identical to the php one I created above.  The only difference is the use of a deal struct to pass the values in as a single object.\n\nThe php client is so basic I won't even show it.  In the middle of the client skeleton's try block, I created a new Sale_deal() object, assigned the same values used to test the php code and called the calc_apr() function.\nI first plugged in the numbers from the general case.  As expected, there is some overhead to all the generated code, but not as much as I thought there would be.\nResult:\nreal    0m0.037s\nuser    0m0.030s\nsys     0m0.007s\nThe big difference is in the worst case.  The performance benefits of a compiled language really start to shine here.\nResult:\nreal    0m0.057s\nuser    0m0.027s\nsys     0m0.011s\nThe worst case scenario may seem unfair, but it represents what is really going on with our finance calculations at work.  The complexity is much higher and there are even iterations within iterations to figure out some of the more obscure numbers.  With this comparison, Thrift appears to be a viable alternative to our current approach to services.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/04/20/exploring-facebooks-thrift.html/","title":"Exploring Facebook's Thrift"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/06/17/more-reliable-authentication-in-zend-framework.html/":{"body":"Stefan Esser gave a presentation on Secure Programming with the Zend Framework at the 2009 Dutch PHP Conference.  While the presentation was good, one thing that bothered me was the way authentication was being handled.\n\nNote that this a very minimal example of how I handle authentication.  Please make sure to completely implement, document and test before putting this on a production server.\nStefan's suggested implementation is to extend the Zend_Controller_Action class to create a custom controller class and use the init() method to determine if the user is logged in.  Developers are expected to then extend this new class to create specific controllers.  The obvious problem with this approach, as Stefan mentions, is that anyone who overloads the init() method must make sure to call the parent's init() method.  If security relies on an individual developer remembering to call the correct methods, then the system is not very secure.  Stefan makes a comment similar to this in the XSS section of his presentation.\nI think the better solution to handle the authentication is to create a controller plugin.  The authentication controller plugin is registered in one spot, the bootstrap, thus making it much more reliable.  There really isn't much more work to do to use a plugin either.\nStart by extending the Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract class.\n\nIn the bootstrap, make sure to register the plugin before calling the front controller's dispatch() method.\n\nThe above method works fine if your login page is outside your MVC routing.  If you use a login controller, there is some more work to do.  A white-list of controllers and actions must be maintained to signal the authentication adapter that authentication is not required.  I keep the white-list as a hard-coded array inside the authentication plugin class itself.  Our class then becomes:\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/06/17/more-reliable-authentication-in-zend-framework.html/","title":"More Reliable Authentication in Zend Framework"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/06/22/a-static-method-abuse.html/":{"body":"When I began taking over the web development project at work, I noticed a developer using a lot of static members and methods in his class definitions.  His explanation was that it was an optimization he used to improve performance.  Unfortunately, he had no metrics to back the statement up.  So I set out to do some of my own.\n\nThe developer was using static methods and members in abstract classes.  Here is a very simple example:\n\nThis was complimented by a call in the MVC bootstrap:\n\nThe developer explained to me that this forces each concrete model class to use the same database class.  He said his reason for doing this was that PHP's copy-on-write functionality made a copy of the database object each time the internal results of that class changed.\nI ran some tests (results below) to see if this was true and it, partially, was.  If any part of a class changes, PHP performs a shallow copy.  That is, if a database class contains a result class, only the result class will be copied and changed if a select query is performed.  The internal reference counter of the database class will simply be incremented.\nI also tested whether static members and methods circumvented the shallow copy and they do.  However, this is not without confusion.  The results from the database class must be stored somewhere else before another query is made.  The next query will overwrite the previous results and cause some real confusion if someone forgets to do this.\nThis whole mess started as a code optimization technique.  It looked to like pre-optimization on code that was never that slow to begin with.  The developer thought that a deep copy of the class was being performed, but never actually bothered to check it out.  The amount of time and resources saved by using the static approach is infinitesimal that it is definitely not worth it.\nI have a small framework that I intentionally wrote this into.  In a future post, I will be using this to outline the steps I used to refactor the code.\nTests\nNon-static test:\n\n\nStatic test:\n\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/06/22/a-static-method-abuse.html/","title":"Static Method Abuse"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/07/08/crimson-framework-php-5-3-branch.html/":{"body":"I have added a PHP 5.3 branch to the Crimson framework.

I don't mean to imply that there is one correct way of completing a task, only that doing it correctly does not involve cutting corners or using hacks to complete the task.&nbsp; I have always preached this ideal as a developer, never the decision maker.&nbsp; Now, I am currently working on a project with a few colleagues of mine where I am a decision maker.&nbsp; Earlier today I began wondering whether my ideals will change as this project grows.\n\nTo be clear, I do not think that doing it \"right\" necessarily means perfection.  For some aspects of development, perfection is impossible or not worth the resources required.  For example, I have never seen a large application with a 100% test coverage.  Some aspects of a program are harder to test than others and the cost may far outweigh the benefits.  I think test coverage of 80% is a very acceptable goal. Another example is the practice of writing a test for each resolved bug.  Again, the costs may outweigh the benefits for very trivial bugs.&nbsp; For me, making a significant attempt at testing means it is being done \"right\" even if it is not perfect.\nThere are aspects of development that can be nearly perfect.  The coding standard, once decided upon, should be adhered to everywhere.  Tools, like PHP_CodeSniffer, inform the developer of any deviation from the standard.  This makes it trivial for any such deviation to be fixed before the code makes it into production. Yet many companies never enforce their coding standard. The fact that it takes minimal effort for the developer to write code that adheres to the standard, I think that doing it \"right\" means no violations are reported from PHP_CodeSniffer.\nDoing it \"right\" means more than just high test coverage and code that adheres to a standard.&nbsp; These are things that are easily measured and very visible.&nbsp; Other aspects of development like design and code re-use are just as important. It is very easy to use the Registry Anti-pattern during development because it can get results fast.&nbsp; Planning out proper dependency injection takes time, especially if one does not do it often.&nbsp; Code refactoring to allow for code re-use is easily pushed off too because it is not immediately necessary.&nbsp; Proper design and code re-use are long term investments in a project that pay off dividends.\nAt what point do the aforementioned ideals become secondary. If a paying client needs a significant modification to a project completed tomorrow, I may throw testing and proper design out the window to make the deadline if I am hurting for income.&nbsp; All the design and re-use in the world are worth nothing if the project dies tomorrow.&nbsp; However, if I find myself in that position then I think I made a mistake somewhere else along the way.\nI hope to use this post as a litmus test to measure my growth in the industry.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/09/06/doing-it-right.html/","title":"Doing It \"Right\""},"https://hermanradtke.com/2009/10/25/hidden-features-with-spl_autoload-and-namespaces.html/":{"body":"The namespace operator in PHP 5.3 is a backslash ().

The added side benefit of this is that spl_autoload() knows how to autoload classes that use a namespace style that matches the directory layout.\n\nThe spl_autoload() function gets passed the fully qualified namespace as well as the class name.  This is very similar to the PEAR class naming convention of using underscore characters (_) to denote the path to a class.\nConsider the following:\nThe spl_autoload() funtion is passed the string 'foo\\Bar'.  The extensions registered by spl_autoload_extensions() are then used in conjunction with include paths to look for a valid file.

It also means more work to setup your tests because you have to keep in mind an order of operations when testing.\nThe better approach:\n\nNotice how the parseFullName function is being told what to parse rather than asking what to parse.&nbsp; This subtle change now allows us to truly test this individual unit of code with the least amount of outside environment interaction.\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2010/01/17/unit-testing-and-the-law-of-demeter.html/","title":"Unit Testing and the Law of Demeter"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2010/02/05/canonical-version-numbers-with-git.html/":{"body":"Brandon Savage wrote a controversial blog post about why subversion is still more relevant than git.&nbsp; His main point was that enterprise requires canonical version numbering to track progress in the application and that git cannot do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot of debate about this on Brandson's, but a recent comment by Morgan proved Brandon wrong.\n\nI have never had a problem with the lack of canonical version numbers, but I can see why companies who have used CVS or subversion for a long time would be wary of getting rid of them.&nbsp; Morgan explains how to use the git describe command to generate canonical version numbers.&nbsp; I have used git for a while for personal projects and at HauteLook, but have never used this command.&nbsp; I thought this was a great solution to a problem a lot of companies face when trying to migrate from subversion to git.\nMorgan's comment:\ngit describe –tags –long\nThis gives you a string like (in the case of one of my projects)\n2.1pre5-4-g675eae1\nwhich is formatted as\n{last reachable tag name}-{# of commits since that tag}-#{SHA of HEAD}\nThis gives you a ‘canonical version number’ (spelling corrected) that is monotonically increasing by commits, and unique across multiple repositories of development.

This is normally not a big deal: retrieve the data, store it in an array and pass it off to the class with the business logic.&nbsp; Mocking the data for the unit test simply requires you to hardcode from array information in the test.&nbsp; However, I recently ran into a case where I wanted to pass Zend_Db_Table_Row and Zend_Db_Table_Row objects to the business logic and mocking them was not so easy.\n\nCreating a mock row object is much like hardcoding an array. &nbsp; Define an array that has a single key 'data' that contains an array as a value.&nbsp;  Inside this array, the database column name is the array key and the database column value is the array value.\nThat class works great for mocking a single row object, but I still needed a solution for multiple row objects.&nbsp;

For testing purposes, I created an 'id' field. &nbsp; I normally would not ever use an artificial key field inside a business logic class since that value is very dependent on the database.\nI created a ZendDbTableMockRowset class in my projects test/mocks directory so I can use it in multiple test files.&nbsp;

I think Lithium is a great looking framework and can't wait for it to get a 1.0 release and really start to take off.&nbsp; However, looking through the examples I started to notice that the use of the \"use\" namespace keyword was an often used convention.&nbsp; It reminded me of the require/require_once creep of the days of old.&nbsp; I was discussing it with Nate via Twitter, but I couldn't seem to get my point across.&nbsp; Maybe I will have better luck here...\n\nWhat do I mean by require_once creep?&nbsp; I simply mean that there are require_once statements including code that doesn't need to be included.&nbsp; This caused a couple of problems:\n\n\tMore code for the PHP parser to parse and thus a slower application\n\tConfusing code dependencies\n\nNow, admittedly problem 2 is not the major issue problem 1 is.&nbsp; However, nothing is more frustrating than removing a innocuous require_once from a file only to have some other random file break because it was including that file and depending on that require_once.&nbsp; There is an entire PHP extension dedicated to helping people solve this very problem: inclued.&nbsp; I still remember Mozilla's conference talk about refactoring TikiWiki to not simply include every nearly every single library file on every single page.\nTo fix this problem, autoloading was introduced.&nbsp; This allowed people to stop using require_once and spawned a method of pseudo-namespacing files.&nbsp; One of the more popular methods of psuedo-namespacing was the PEAR standard.&nbsp; This standard said to name the class based on the directory location of the class.&nbsp; So if I have class in herman/awesome/Solution.php I would name the class Herman_Awesome_Solution.&nbsp; This obviously gave rise to some pretty long class names, but people generally loved it as it saved them from require_once creep.\nLet's fast forward to PHP 5.3.&nbsp; The \"use\" keyword is introduced to let users alias long namespaces to a shorter name.&nbsp; So I can reference the namespace \\this\\is\\a\\really\\long\\namespace as longns.&nbsp; This is great, now I can reference a really long namespace with a single word.&nbsp; All I have to do is remember to alias it.&nbsp; And the aliases are descending, so if I alias a class that alias two other classes, I can use those additional aliases free of charge.\nBut wait, doesn't it seem like we just went full circle with naming conventions?&nbsp; We started with simple class names with require_once creep, graduated to autoloading and using super long class names and are now back using simple class names with use creep.&nbsp; The use creep doesn't have the performance halting side effects of require_once, but it sure seems like it can cause quite a dependency maintenance nightmare.&nbsp; It may be no problem for you, but what about the guy coding next to you who really doesn't care?\nI think I will stick to using the fully qualified namespace (FQN) of a class.&nbsp; It will take a few more keystrokes, but it keep my dependencies cleaner.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2010/04/19/dont-overuse-use.html/","title":"Don't Overuse Use"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2010/07/05/learning-to-use-mongodb.html/":{"body":"I have heard of MongoDB for some time and have read quite a few articles and attended some conference seminars about it.&nbsp;

It usually carries with  it a positive connotation and a developer writing reusable code is seen  as a good thing.&nbsp; I think there are a lot of developers who have a completely different understanding of what code reuse means.&nbsp; When I talk about code reuse, I am talking about reusing logic within the code.&nbsp; Based on code reviews, it  seems the most common definition of reuse is: anytime a function or  method is used by two or more callers.&nbsp; This definition fails to realize  the true meaning of reuse and can lead to problems.&nbsp; In the name of  \"reuse\", I have noticed some developers group common code at the application  level by creating functions or methods that solve some pseudo-generic  problem.&nbsp; I call this type or reuse inverted reuse.\nInverted  reuse, while initially attractive, often causes a maintenance  nightmare.&nbsp; A developer notices that they are repeating some common logic over and over (probably through copy and pasting) while writing  some application code and decides to make a common method.&nbsp; While  preventing copy/paste code is good, it should not be done at the cost of  extensibility and code clarity.&nbsp; The easiest way to see inverted reuse  is by example.&nbsp; Consider the following:\n\nThe use of the  protected _filter method is a classic example of inverted reuse.&nbsp; The  email, password and name parameters are common to both the create and update  public methods.&nbsp; However, the update method needs an additional parameter,  called id, to determine what member to update.&nbsp; It is quite obvious that the  more parameters the _filter method has to filter, the more complicated  the method becomes.&nbsp; Some parameters may be only applicable to the create method as well, such as  Google Analytics values.&nbsp; There are a couple solutions to this particular case of inverted reuse.&nbsp;  One approach would be to only use the _filter method for the common  parameters and to have each public method filter and validate the unique  parameters.&nbsp; I think this fix still misses the real point of reuse.&nbsp;  The _filter method really does two things: uses filter_input_array and  determines which parameters are required.&nbsp; This same logic is probably going to be required all over the code.&nbsp; Consider the following:\n\nI am not going to define the Filter class as it really  does not matter how it gets implemented.&nbsp; There are a number of benefits to moving the logic in the _filter method into a separate class.&nbsp; Putting this class at the  library level allows the entire application to use it.&nbsp; It is also much  easier to unit test this class as it does one thing and it does that thing  abstractly.&nbsp; We can also extend, wrap or compose this class if there is  the need.&nbsp; This is a truly object oriented approach to solving the  filter problem.\nYou might notice that both public methods look very similar.&nbsp; The  $def array is only slightly different in the update method, the  $optional array is exactly the same and the use of the Filter class is  identical.&nbsp; This is completely fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are reusing the same business  logic inside the Filter class and that is what code reuse is all about.&nbsp;  Each public method's intention is clearly defined this way too.&nbsp; The  context (create or update) required for filtering is implicit.&nbsp; Contrast  this with the _filter method which required an explicit context to be  passed around.&nbsp; I would argue that using an implicit context not only  makes the code easier to understand, it also reduces the chance of  causing bugs.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2010/12/06/stop-inverted-reuse.html/","title":"Stop Inverted Reuse"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2010/12/11/bootstrapping-phpunit-tests.html/":{"body":"I just recently stumbled upon PHPUnit's --bootstrap flag.

After reading a great post about Poison Jobs, I limited the number of attempts the gearman daemon will retry a job.&nbsp; This seemed fairly straight-forward to me: if a job fails, then the gearman daemon will retry the job the specified number of times.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that it was not that simple.&nbsp; There is specific criteria the gearman daemon follows in order to retry a job.\n\nThis all came about when I noticed a particular gearman worker was throwing an uncaught exception under certain conditions.&nbsp; I assumed that an uncaught exception would cause the gearman daemon to retry the job.&nbsp; I found out that not only did gearman not retry the job, the client was receiving a return code of GEARMAN_SUCCESS.&nbsp; In other words, the client had no idea the worker was blowing up.\nThe GearmanJob class provides some methods to inform the gearman daemon the result of a job.&nbsp; They are primarily used for synchronous jobs.&nbsp; The sendComplete method will cause the gearman daemon to send a return code of GEARMAN_SUCCESS to the client and can also be used to pass data back to the client.&nbsp; The sendFail method will cause the gearman daemon to send a return code of GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL.&nbsp; This may seem fairly obvious, but it is important to note that calling sendFail will not cause the job to be automatically retried.&nbsp; The client code would have to recognize a return code of GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL and decide whether or not to call the job again.\nThen there is the sendException method, which will cause the gearman daemon to send a return code of GEARMAN_WORK_EXCEPTION to the client.&nbsp; Do not make the mistake I did by thinking this will implicitly be called if a worker throws an uncaught exception.&nbsp; The main difference between sendFail and sendException is that a string detailing the exception can be added to the sendException method.&nbsp; If you wrap a worker in a try/catch block, you can catch exceptions and call sendException with the exception error message.&nbsp; The sendFail method does not take any parameters and leaves the client guessing as to why the failure occurred.\nThe worker does not know if it was called synchronously or not.&nbsp; If the worker was called synchronously, using any of the aforementioned methods will allow the client to determine the status of the job.&nbsp; The client can then decide whether or not to retry a failed job.&nbsp; If the worker was called asynchronously, sending back the job status falls on deaf ears.&nbsp; Nothing is listening for the job status and the gearman daemon will not log failed jobs.\nWe still have no idea what criteria must be met in order for the gearman daemon to retry a job.&nbsp; I read some gearman mailing lists and perused the daemon source code and I think I have found a definitive answer.&nbsp; The worker must exit with a non-zero code during a job in order for the gearman daemon to retry the job.&nbsp; The strange thing is that an uncaught exception causes a php script to exit with a code of 255.&nbsp; Explicitly calling exit(255) will force a retry, but an uncaught exception will definitely not force a retry.&nbsp; In fact, an uncaught exception will not even cause a GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL or GEARMAN_WORK_EXCEPTION return code.\nAfter some reviewing of the pecl/gearman code, I have found that the pecl/gearman worker code is not checking for an exception before returning GEARMAN_SUCCESS.&nbsp; I have submitted a bug report with a patch to at least return GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL when an exception is enountered instead of GEARMAN_SUCCESS.&nbsp; I do think there is an argument to be made that an uncaught exception should force a retry of the job, but I will leave that discussion for another day.\nThe best way to force a job retry on an uncaught exception is to simply use the exit() function.\n\nThis will cause your worker to stop running, but so will an uncaught exception.&nbsp; Most gearman architectures have a monitor that will restart fallen workers.&nbsp; If you don't, get one and have it send out alerts if any worker exists with a status of non-zero.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/04/11/retrying-failed-gearman-jobs.html/","title":"Retrying Failed Gearman Jobs"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/02/working-with-the-php-source-tree.html/":{"body":"The svn repository for PHP is rather large.&nbsp;

Now we need to start building pecl extensions and even php itself.&nbsp; I prefer to use Cent OS for my linux needs and naturally use rpm's to track all my packages.&nbsp; This means I have a stable version of php installed with all the various extensions that I could want.&nbsp; Rather than messing with this stable version, I am going to build a custom debug build of php in /usr/local.&nbsp; I say \"debug\", because this build of php will use the --enable-debug option to allow easy debugging using gdb.&nbsp; Since I am doing pecl extension development, I don't want to build the trunk version of php.&nbsp; I want to build my pecl extensions against the most recent stable version of php to isolate environmental issues as much as possible.\nNow building php from an svn tag is more tricky than building from a snapshot.&nbsp; The goal is to start building extensions, so rather than waste time navigating the hurdles of building from svn, I will just grab the latest stable version of php from php.net.&nbsp; Building php becomes very similar to any other program you have compiled from source.\n\nwget http://www.php.net/get/php-5.3.6.tar.gz/from/this/mirror\ntar xzf php-5.3.6.tar.gz\ncd php-5.3.6\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php-5.3.6 --with-config-file-path=/usr/local/php-5.3.6/etc --enable-debug\nmake\nmake test #optional\nsudo make install\nsudo cp php.ini-development /usr/local/php-5.3.6/etc/php.ini\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/php-5.3.6 /usr/local/php\n\nYou will notice that I specified a version specific prefix for php to be installed at.&nbsp; I do this so I can build multiple versions without clobbering an older build.&nbsp; However, this makes maintaining any helper scripts a pain as the version continually changes.&nbsp; To make things easier, I created a symlink so I can specify /usr/local/php for any helper scripts.&nbsp; You may also want to add /usr/local/php/bin to your PATH in .bash_profile.\nNow let's compile the pecl/memcache extesnsion.\n\ncd php/src/pecl/memcache/trunk\nphpize\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake\nmake test\n\nThe phpize script is a bash script that bootstraps the environment for the pecl extension based on your installed version of php.&nbsp; If you have multiple php versions installed, it is very important that you are using the correct phpize script.&nbsp; I suggest using 'which phpize' to make sure that /usr/local/php/bin/phpize is the script you are using.\nNow you will notice that I did not perform a 'make install'.&nbsp; I generally don't install my extensions while developing with them.&nbsp; I sometimes bounce back and forth between a few different version of an extension trying to fix various bugs and implement new features.&nbsp; I prefer to specify the full path to the extension in my php.ini file.  The extension line will look something like this:\n\nextension=/home/hradtke/projects/php/src/pecl/memcache/trunk/modules/memcache.so\n\nOnce that line is added you can verify the extension is loaded properly by running 'php -m'.  If you want more detail, you can run 'php -i'.\nNow you can start playing with the code.  If you are unsure where to start, I suggest reading these articles:\n\n\tExtension Writing Part I: Introduction to PHP and Zend\n\tExtension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs\n\tExtension Writing Part III: Resources\n\tWhat the heck is TSRMLS_CC, anyway?\n\tZend API: Hacking the Core of PHP\n\tExtending PHP\n\nIf you get through all that and still want to know more, I suggest purchasing Sara Goleman's book Extending and Embedding PHP.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/07/building-php-pecl-extensions.html/","title":"Building php pecl extensions"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/08/patching-a-bug-in-a-pecl-extension.html/":{"body":"In my last post I explained how to build a development version of a pecl extension.&nbsp;  Now we will go through the bug lifecycle in the pecl/memcache extension.&nbsp; Besides writing the actual C code to fix the bug, it is considered a best practice to write a test that verifies the bug has been fixed.&nbsp; I will use PECL bug #16442 - memcache_set fail with integer value as an example, even though it is already been fixed.\nWhether creating a patch for a bug fix yourself or applying a users patch to an existing bug, the process is pretty much the same.&nbsp; The very first thing I do is create a .phpt test for the bug.&nbsp; A .phpt test is a functional test used in php core and many pecl extensions.&nbsp; All bug fixes should include a simple test so we can verify the bug is indeed fixed by the patch and to prevent a regression in the code where the bug is reintroduced.&nbsp; The .phpt functional tests are quick to write and have such a positive long term investment I rarely find myself not wanting to write them.\nHere is an example test:\n\n--TEST--\nPECL bug #16442 (memcache_set fail with integer value)\n--FILE--\n&lt;?php\ninclude 'connect.inc';\nmemcache_set($memcache, 'test123112', 1, MEMCACHE_COMPRESSED, 30);\n$ret = memcache_get($memcache, 'test123112');\nvar_dump($ret);\necho \"Done\\n\";\n?&gt;\n--EXPECT--\nint(0)\nDone\n\nThere are three basic parts to a .phpt file: test information, the test itself and the expected test results.&nbsp; The test information section is denoted by the \"--TEST--\" heading.&nbsp; This is where information about the test is placed.&nbsp; For bug fixes I normally include the bug number and a brief description of the bug.&nbsp; The brief description sometimes matches the bug title, but there are cases where the bug title doesn't describe the actual bug so I will make a better description up.\nAfter the informational block&nbsp; is the actual test itself, denoted by the \"--FILE--\" heading.&nbsp; The test itself is always normal php code.&nbsp; You will notice that the test includes a 'connect.inc' file.&nbsp; This is a standard convention for tests that depend on some outside system or environment.&nbsp; In the case of pecl/memcache, the connect.inc sets up a number of connections to memcache using various ip addresses, ports and protocols (tcp and udp).&nbsp; This is done to make sure all tests are testing against the same servers and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code in the tests.&nbsp; It is considered a best practice to use var_dump() for any kind of test output.&nbsp; This makes the output as explicit as possible.&nbsp; You will also notice many tests end with an echo \"OK\\n\" or an echo \"Done\\n\" statement.&nbsp; This is done to explicitly define the end of the test.&nbsp; This can help catch extra test output, such as warnings or errors, that should cause the test to fail.\nThe last section is the expected test results section.&nbsp; There are a number of different ways to express test results, including normal string comparison (--EXPECT--), printf style formatting (--EXPECTF--) and regular expressions(--EXPECTREGEX--).&nbsp; Explaining how each of them work and when to use each one is would take an entire blog article itself.&nbsp; Luckily, the PHP QA team has an article that discussions each one in detail.&nbsp; I almost always use EXPECTF for the test results, even if I am not using any format characters.&nbsp; This is more the result of copy/paste than any explicit decision on my part.&nbsp; You should try to be as generic in your test output as possible.&nbsp; For example, if you are expecting a warning to show in the test results, make sure you do not explicitly check for your local path to the file in the warning output.&nbsp; This will cause the test to fail for anyone else.\nI mentioned earlier that there are three parts to a .php test, but I lied.&nbsp; There are actually a few more, but they are less commonly used.&nbsp; I suggest you read through the PHP QA article on writing .phpt tests for a full explanation of .phpt test syntax and usage.&nbsp; I am merely highlighting the major points to get us up and running.\nI have noticed that there is a general best practice to naming .phpt test files.&nbsp; Non bug fix .phpt tests are sequentially numbers starting from 001.&nbsp; I call these feature tests.&nbsp; As development continues on a package, new tests are created.&nbsp; You will notice there are over 100 features tests in pecl/memcache/branches/NON_BLOCKING_IO/tests.&nbsp; For bug fixes, .phpt tests follow the format of 'pecl{bug #}.phpt'.&nbsp; This means I would name the .phpt test file for PECL bug #16442 as pecl16442.phpt.\nNaturally we want to run the test once it is written.&nbsp; The php community has provided a tool, called run-tests.php, that runs all or a subset of tests for a given package.&nbsp; The run-tests.php script is pretty flexible.&nbsp; You can specify a directory to run all tests in, specify a list of tests to run or specify a single test to run.&nbsp; Here are some examples:\n\nrun a single test\nTEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/php/bin/php php run-tests.php tests/pecl16442.phpt\nrun a two tests\nTEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/php/bin/php php run-tests.php tests/pecl16442.phpt tests/pecl16536.phpt\nrun all tests in the tests/ directory\nTEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/php/bin/php php run-tests.php tests/\n\nThe syntax of these commands might look a little strange.&nbsp; The run-tests.php does not try to assume which php executable you want to run the tests against.&nbsp; Without this variable being set, the script will throw an error that looks like: \"ERROR: environment variable TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE must be set to specify PHP executable!\".&nbsp; I am using a bash trick to set the PHP_TEST_EXECUTABLE variable before running each test.&nbsp; You can also export this variable so it is available each time you run the tests.&nbsp; If you decide to export it, you should consider adding it to your .bash_profile so you don't have to do it each time you login.&nbsp; Whichever way you do it, as long as you set this variable before running the run-tests.php script you will be fine.\nRunning the tests will generate some nicely formatted output.&nbsp; The output is self-explanatory, so I will not go over it here.&nbsp; I do want to talk about some interesting things that happen when a test fails.&nbsp; I changed the \"--EXPECT--\" portion of my test example to \"int(0)\".&nbsp; If you run this test you will notice it listed in the \"FAILED TEST SUMMARY\".&nbsp; What you don't see is the actual test output or even more importantly why test failed.&nbsp; Thankfully, run-tests.php has us covered.&nbsp; If you look at the output of the tests/ directory you will notice some new files:\n\ntests/pecl16442.diff # a diff of the expected output and results\ntests/pecl16442.exp # the expected output\ntests/pecl16442.log # a log of the test run\ntests/pecl16442.out # the actual test output\ntests/pecl16442.php # the php code used to run the test\n\nI find the .out and .php files most useful when debugging code.&nbsp; When trying to fix a bug I will run the test using run-tests.php once and the continually test against the .php file until I am reasonably sure I have fixed the bug.&nbsp; I will then use run-tests.php again and see if it passed.&nbsp; The .out file is useful to see exactly what the test result actually was.&nbsp; I sometimes use the .diff file when I am head scratching as to why a test I think should have passed is not passing.&nbsp; Some trivial issues such as newlines and extra spacing can sometimes create a false positive in an otherwise passing test.\nAfter applying the fix to the memcache source code to allow integer values in memcache_set and using run-tests.php to check if the test pecl16442.phpt passes, we need to make sure we run all the tests.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, the existing tests are a there to help prevent regressions in the source code.&nbsp; One should always check that all tests pass before committing any new code.&nbsp; I will mention that this can be frustrating when working with a pecl extension that has tests that always seem to fail.&nbsp; If this is the case, use your best judgement.&nbsp; You may also want to fix the failing tests before doing any new work on the extension too.\nOnce all the tests pass, commit your changed source code files and the .phpt test file(s).&nbsp; Make sure you do not include any of the failed test files that are automatically generated.&nbsp; If you do not have commit access, include the source code files in the bug report along with the test.&nbsp; There is nothing any pecl maintainer likes more than having tests included with the patch.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/08/patching-a-bug-in-a-pecl-extension.html/","title":"Patching a bug in a pecl extension"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/10/writing-debuggable-code.html/":{"body":"Coding standards are religious in nature, ranking high on the list near vim vs emacs.&nbsp; Paul Reinheimer woke up many in the twitterverse with a simple post:\n\n\nDebug-ability is simply writing code in such a way that it makes it easy to step through the code in a debugger.&nbsp; I built my career using a debugger.&nbsp; My first programming job out of college was at a C shop that started in the late 1980's.&nbsp; My college professors instructed me using C++, so I was somewhat familiar with the C/C++ variety of languages.&nbsp; After looking at the C code on my first day of work, I quickly realized I had a lot to learn.&nbsp; Luckily I was well versed in gdb.&nbsp; For those not familiar with gdb, gdb is the GNU C debugger.&nbsp; It is probably the most important tool for anyone working with the C code.&nbsp; There was no way I could grok some of the logic, such as pointer arithmetic, in the code without stepping through it with gdb and poking at it.&nbsp; This invaluable experience has made me a debugger zealot.&nbsp; Not only that, but I find that fixing bugs is usually a therapeutic exercise for me.\nI am constantly surprised at the number of web developers who still do not use a debugger. Before Xdebug and Firebug were created, web development drove me nuts.&nbsp;  Finding bugs always felt like game of cat and mouse as I riddled the  source code with calls to die('here') (or alert('here') for the Javascript code)  until I found the bug.&nbsp; Yet, I still find many developers using a combination of y() and die() to solve problems.&nbsp; Xdebug has been out for years, is easy to setup and makes finding that bug in your code so much easier.\nSo, what do I consider debuggable code to look like?&nbsp; Code that has one statement per line.&nbsp; I don't care about braces, naming conventions, line endings, tabs/spaces or anything else that has little effect on how the code runs.&nbsp; One statement per line makes it much easier to determine exactly what the code is doing when stepping through the debugger.&nbsp; This may seem like a pain since it will cause files to have more lines, but I don't care.&nbsp; The time it takes to write the code is only 20% of that codes lifecycle.&nbsp; The other 80% is maintenance where it is being extended, bug fixed and maybe even refactored.&nbsp; Taking a little bit of extra time to wrote easy to debug code in beginning is an investment that will quickly pay off.\nHere are some examples of code that were not written with debug-ability in mind:\n\nThis makes it hard to tell if doSomething() was actually called.&nbsp; Sure I can print the value of $foo in the debugger, but letting the debugger step through the code leaves all guess work out.&nbsp; There are still a lot of developers who think doSomething() will be executed if the previous line of code was: $foo = array().&nbsp; No amount of var_dump is going to show that an empty array is falsy in php.&nbsp; Putting the call to doSomething() on a second line makes it very clear if that line of code was executed when stepping through it on the debugger.\n\nHow do we know if both functions were called?&nbsp; We might add breakpoints to both functions so we can track it, but it is much easier to assign the results of each function to a variable and put the two variables in an if statement.\n\nSimilar to the last line of code, but it is important to note.&nbsp; Complex if statements are very hard to debug.&nbsp; I prefer to break this statement apart into separate if statements and use a variable or two to track the results of each section.&nbsp; This might not always be possible, but it works a great deal of the time.\n\nLogic inside to create an array key is fine, but assigning it to a variable makes it a lot more clear as to what is being looked up.&nbsp; I chose to highlight a ternary operator here as I see a lot of younger developers using it for the sole reason that it is less typing and takes up less space than writing out a proper if statement.\nAll of the above statements can be inspected using a debugger with a little extra work, but when you are stepping through hundreds of lines of code searching for a bug all of these little bits of extra work add up.&nbsp; The debugger does not lie and the simplest little bits of code can hide the most glaring bugs.&nbsp; Start writing code with debug-ability in mind and, if you have not already, start using your debugger.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/10/writing-debuggable-code.html/","title":"Writing debuggable code"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/12/managing-multiple-jquery-promises.html/":{"body":"The new jQuery 1.5 version has support for promises.&nbsp; Promises allows code to be dependent on the completion of an asynchronous event.&nbsp; Promises are most commonly used when making an AJAX request.&nbsp; I recently had to solve a problem where I was issuing many AJAX requests and wanted to make sure all were completed before moving on to the next task.&nbsp; To make matters more complicated, I was issuing the requests using jsonp.&nbsp; Some of the requests were chained from other requests as well.&nbsp; Trying to track all the promises by individually was becoming a mess.&nbsp;

Let's look at an example on how to use it.\n\nThe above example is making a series of requests for account information on a list of users.&nbsp; Looping over the array of users, we push an anonymous function into an array call promises.&nbsp; This anonymous function simply gives all() something to execute when call it.&nbsp; We then wrap each ajax request in a promise&nbsp; using $.Deferred().&nbsp; We specify a callback that is the ajax request and then call promise() on $.Deferred.&nbsp; The effect of this is that the all() function will iterate of the array of promises and execute each anonymous function.&nbsp; The anonymous function returns the promise and the all() function keeps track of the state of each promise.&nbsp; Once all the promises have been resolved, the all() function will resolve itself internal promise.&nbsp; This allows use to use the all() function as single argument to $.when() that represents a set of promises we are expecting to finish.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/05/12/managing-multiple-jquery-promises.html/","title":"managing multiple jQuery promises"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/07/14/how-phpunit-saved-hautelook-a-lot-of-duckles.html/":{"body":"\nA few days ago Hudson began emailing alerts that a freight calculation unit test was failing in production. I emailed the developers responsible for the code and asked them to investigate this right away. The funny thing about unit tests failing in production is that developers can fall into a mindset of \"the code is working on production, so there must not be a problem\". The freight calculations did appear to be working correctly on production. Because we are so busy, no further investigation was done until yesterday.\nYesterday afternoon two developers realized that this failing unit test was the result of a serious regression in our \"premium\" freight calculation. This freight calculation type is most commonly used for furniture items and can easily calculate a shipping cost well over $100. This particular bug was calculating the \"premium\" freight costs as free. Now HauteLook's business model is flash sales. This means new sales events start at 8:00 am PT each morning and most of the business is done within the first few hours of the event.

While I don't deny that is true, I think Twitter still allows for great social discovery. When people retweet or reply to tweets it engages people from the outside. \nI joined Twitter late compared to most of the people I interact with. I did not see the value in it at first, but gradually began to understand how important it is in keeping up with the open source community. I signed up and started following those same people whose blogs I read. As those people tweeted I gradually began to follow more and more people that interested me. The re-tweet is a great for discovering new blogs or projects that interest me. A re-tweet is an awesome way for someone to point out something they think is interesting. The re-tweet takes only seconds as well. Twitter conversations are harder to follow, but it is a conversation fragment is usually enough to decide it the conversation is interesting enough to find the main thread. The Twitter website does try and track what tweet was in reply to another tweet, but it is definitely lacking.\nI have yet to find this same sort of social discovery on Facebook. I really don't use Facebook that much because I feel that I am interacting with the same people I always interact with. I do see new faces that comment on posts of people I follow. However, I want to see people I follow commenting on posts of people I don't follow. Even better, I want people I follow to highlight a good article, blog post or conversation. I feel that when people comment on something, they are less likely to then re-tweet it. Most of the re-tweets I see have a short opinion in front of them, such as \"Amazing read!

The ClientLogin part of the Google Data Protocol must be used to obtain an Auth token. The ClientLogin is simply a GET request with three paramters. The service parameter gives the user access to the particular API. In this case, the service parameter value is \"reader\" for Google Reader. The next two parameters are email and password. These values are the same as what one would use to login to Google Reader using a normal webpage. The response will contain newline delimited key/value pairs. One of those pairs will be the Auth token.\nRequests to the Google Reader API can then be made using this Auth token in an Authorization header.

So much in fact that I recently decided to take over the maintenance of pecl/gearman. While asynchronous tasks are a great feature, I find the ability to run multiple tasks in parallel to be much more useful. One of the biggest shortcomings of this approach was that uncaught worker exceptions would be treated as a successful completion of a job. I used to wrap all my workers in a generic try/catch block to prevent this from happening.&nbsp; With the latest commits to pecl/gearman, I can now use the exception callback to properly track the exceptions.\n\nEvery once in a while one of the workers would throw an exception that would not be caught. One would expect that this would trigger GearmanClient::setExceptionCallback(). Until recently, pecl/gearman was not properly handling exceptions from workers. This might not be so bad if an uncaught exception sent back a status of GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL and triggered the fail callback. The problem was that an uncaught worker exception actually sent back GEARMAN_SUCCESS. This made it appear to the client that the tasks was successfully completed. The workaround at the time was to wrap all workers in a generic try/catch block to prevent any uncaught exceptions. The catch block would then need to explicitly send back a status of GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL. This caused a lot of boilerplate code and each developer had to become intimately aware of how fickle pecl/gearman was with exceptions. \nI decided to fix pecl/gearman to properly trigger the exception callback in the event of an uncaught exception. The worker would still die, but now the client would be properly informed. This has to be done in two parts. I had to first update the pecl extension to detect when an exception occurred. The second part was sending back the proper status to the Gearman daemon so the client could be informed. This was a little more tricky than it first appeared. The Gearman daemon does not automatically handle the exception status. Both the client and the worker have to tell the Gearman daemon that they want to enable exceptions when they connect. Once I figured out how to do this using libgearman I was able to trigger the exception callback. \nThis exposed another issue with the way libgearman works. Because the exception handling is optional, the worker will send back a status of GEARMAN_WORK_FAIL even a status of GEARMAN_WORK_EXCEPTION was already sent. This means that the fail callback can be triggered after the exception callback. You can have the exception callback return a status of GEARMAN_WORK_EXCEPTION, but that will cause the entire batch process to stop. I am working with Brian Aker, who maintains libgearman, to see if something can be changed. Until then, I am required to keep track of tasks that threw an exception and check that list in the fail callback.\n\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/08/20/gearman-worker-exception-handling-in-php.html/","title":"Gearman Worker Exception Handling in PHP"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/10/22/please-do-not-interface-the-php-world.html/":{"body":"This started out as a quick response to a blog post titled Interfacing the PHP World by Lukas Kahwe Smith, but it quickly turned into a blog post of its own.\nI think common interfaces would be bad for PHP. I find it ironic that a comment made by Stephen is advocating a Java-like dictatorship to move PHP forward. PHP is much more successful and widely used than Java. It is Java should be learning from PHP, not the other way around. PHP is an ugly language with a mish-mash of syntax and conventions that makes the code not very pretty (especially compared to Python). PHP's only saving grace is that it actually gets things done. And luckily, for PHP, that is all that really matters.\nCaching, logging and http clients may seem like simple things to standardize, but the mere fact that there are so many differing implementations is proof that they are not so simple. This reminds me of the SimpleCloud framework that tries to standardize the different cloud APIs: there is nothing simple about it! Furthermore, trying to standardize things can kill innovation and creativity. I fear the community will reject a new way to do things on the basis that the code does not implement the standard PHP interfaces. The Lithium framework, which takes a very different approach to frameworks, might not even exist if these interfaces were around a few years ago.\nThe most progress comes about when people reject or ignore the so called \"truths\" that surround them. The recent PHP fork is evidence of this. Forking PHP was a huge \"no no\" (despite the ironic fact that PHP is open source). That fork sparked both change and debate and had a positive effect. The author of the fork had tried to play by the rules setup by the PHP internals team and got nowhere. It was only when he decided to publish a fork that people (particularly those in internals) actually started paying attention.\nThis notion of interoperability between frameworks is just like trying to achieve nirvana. It is good to try, but never truly attainable. Look at PDO, a (supposedly) \"lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP\". Except that it doesn't work with any of the NoSQL databases. One may argue that PDO is for SQL databases only, except that no one even considered that fact when it was being written. Simply read http://us2.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php and it makes no mention of being SQL only. It assumed that SQL was all there was at the time of writing. The SQL-99 standard was the gospel for databases. This is the danger in defining standard interfaces. The advent of NoSQL made PDO largely irrelevant. The same fate will happen to any standard interface that we come up with today.\nI encourage freedom the create new things. I don't want all of my frameworks playing by the same rules. If they are all using common interfaces, then we might as well merge all of the frameworks because the competition is over. Instead, let the adoption rate of the framework be the measure of success. I believe this is why PHP has been so successful. Rasmus has the courage to not try and define or predict what PHP needs. He lets the people using PHP decide what they need. This is in stark contrast to other people in internals that try to exert control of the process and define rigid rules and policies. PHP is not a purely procedural, object oriented or functional language. It is a mashup of all kinds of concepts and ideas. The cool thing is that it works.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/10/22/please-do-not-interface-the-php-world.html/","title":"Please Do Not Interface the PHP World"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/11/20/elephpants-for-sale.html/":{"body":"I recently ordered some elePHPants and have some left over for sale.

I did not agree with everything he said though and wanted to start a discussion. Unfortunately, there is no way to leave comments on his blog. The next best thing is to post it here.\n\nThere are some niche tasks where I still use an ORM despite the costs mentioned by Vic and myself. An ORM is great for creating dynamic queries. As we build more rich front-end web applications, it is very easy to build queries with user specified filters and sorting. Trying to do this manually is time-consuming and often bug prone. I find this setup particularly useful when building administrative pages that are looking at lists of things like users or orders. Performance is not a real big issue here and the queries themselves are usually only joining one or two tables. There is still the risk of a runaway query wreaking havoc on your master database. To combat this scare, I advocate a separate slave database to run queries like this.\nVic mentioned that he puts the SQL directory in the controllers, but I think this is a mistake. Controllers are tying the view to the model and should not contain any other logic. I prefer to keep business logic at the library level and data access logic in the model. The controller can consume library or model classes at will and pass them over to the view for output. This may seem like an extra step that is not needed, but it makes testing much easier. There is also the added benefit of being able to write a service layer or API with very little effort should the need arise.\nAll in all I think Vic makes a good argument. I think developers need to learn to embrace databases, SQL or NoSQL, instead of trying to abstract them away. Data is often the most important part of the business and it should be treated as such.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/12/02/orm-frameworks-are-black-magic.html/","title":"ORM frameworks are black magic"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/12/09/pear-channel-created.html/":{"body":"I finally got around to creating my own PEAR channel.

The GearmanManager code assumes that the workers are simply function definitions. This makes it easy to write and organize the workers, but it makes common tasks like debugging workers painful as all output is hidden\nIn order to make development of the gearman workers easier, I created a script to startup the gearman worker in a similar manner to the GearmanManager.

It is very common to see an SPL talk at conferences, but those talks usually just introduce each SPL class to the audience without giving some real world examples. I am going to show you a real world example on how to use SPL FilterIterator in an ecommerce website.\n\nThis particular ecommerce website sells actual goods. One problem with selling actual goods, instead of virtual goods, is the supply can run out. I have a simple use-case where I don't want to display an item that is sold out. Consider the following example data:\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThis is a pretty common use case and I am sure most people would write the logic something like this:\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThere is nothing logically wrong with this code. It is a very readable and easy to understand way to write it. With the rise in popularity of JavaScript and other functional languages, some of us may take a different approach. Using the underscore framework (available for both PHP and JavaScript), you could also write it like this:\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThe use of a callback function should be familiar to anyone with at least a basic knowledge of JavaScript. The callback function is evaluating each item in the iterator to true or false. The major drawback to both of the code snippets is that the logic for determining whether or not an item is sold out is not able to be re-used. The use of procedural code in the first example and the use of an anonymous function in the second example also make it hard to test. We can improve the second example by not using an anonymous callback:\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nNow I can re-use this function and easily test it. We can use SPL FilterIterator in a very similar way to the functional example:\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nNow my logic for what constitutes a soldout item is isolated in a class. This coincides with the object oriented principle of \"encapsulate what varies\". I think the biggest stumbling block for using SPL is that it just seems too heavy. You might be wondering why you should go to the trouble of creating a new class to perform such a simple task. The procedural example above is faster to write. Some of us might be tempted to use the functional example with an anonymous function because it feels more \"expressive\". Now consider what happens when the ecommerce system introduces returns. The new formula for determining a soldout item is now:\n\navailability = (purchased - sold) + returned\n\nThis isn't some hypothetical example, it actually happened. It was real easy to update the logic to handle returns and make sure the tests passed.\nThe last decision you have to make is whether or not to put the logic in a database query. If there is a huge performance boost by writing the logic into the query, it may be worthwhile. A query is still testable, but you have to setup some test data in the database in order to test it (which means you probably won't do write the test for it). It is harder to re-use queries, so the business logic for determining sold out items may be duplicated over a number of queries too. You also might want to consider what happens if you decide to alleviate the database load by putting the list of items for sale in a cache (like APC or memcache).\nThe SPL classes, especially FilterIterator, really start to shine when dealing with a dataset outside of our control. More and more platforms are becoming service based and we have no control over how the data comes back. Especially when you consider something like the Twitter API timeline response and trying to filter out any tweet that starts with \"RT\".\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2011/12/15/spl-filteriterator-in-the-real-world.html/","title":"SPL FilterIterator in the real world"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2012/01/23/the-painful-gearman-upgrade-path.html/":{"body":"The Gearman project has been slowly migrating from C to C++. This migration has gone under the radar due to the popularity of Cent OS 5 and given gearmand version of 0.14. This version of gearmand worked with any version of pecl/gearman and there was never any compelling reason to upgrade gearmand. That changed with the release of pecl/gearman 1.0\n\nI did not think much of the new gearmand requirement when fixing this bug. Since that time I have been introduced to the painful upgrade process of gearmand. I think this pain is mostly felt by those using Linux distributions with long term support. The first hurdle to get over is the fact that gearmand 0.21 requires the boost 1.41 libraries. A default Cent OS install only provides boost 1.39 libraries. There was a 3rd party that provided boost 1.41 libraries for Cent OS, but they used a non-standard installation directory. After some experimenting, I did find a fix:&nbsp;http://groups.google.com/group/gearman/msg/12bcc13691e132ae.\nThe good news is that upgrading to Cent OS 6 makes compiling gearman much easier with the inclusion of boost 1.41 libraries by default. The next problem comes when trying to submit a patch. Cent OS 5 comes with aclocal 1.9 and the gearman project requires aclocal 1.11. Again, upgrading to Cent OS 6 makes life easier as it comes with aclocal 1.11 by default. I learned the hard way that the gearman project also requires autoconf 2.64, but Cent OS 6 only provides autoconf 2.63. The 2.64 version of autoconf provides a macro named m4_ifnblank which is required to build the configure script used to compile gearman. You can see me answer my own question here:&nbsp;https://answers.launchpad.net/gearmand/+question/185592&nbsp;regarding the autoconf issue.\nThese build issues have made it tough for users to upgrade to the pecl/gearman 1.x line. I think I will be forced to maintain the pecl/gearman 0.8.x line for some time with bug fixes as users struggle to get gearmand 0.21 on their Cent OS 5 servers.

One gripe I have is that the examples declare global functions for the worker to register. I feel this leads develpers down the wrong path.

I personally ran into this when I suggested that HauteLook start using GearmanManager to manage the gearman workers. A side affect of this is that all gearman worker scripts now run in the same instance of PHP. There were a number of&nbsp;occasions&nbsp;when workers would fail to load on production because of the global naming conflicts.\nI prefer to use register anonymous functions with my gearman workers. This keeps them out of the global scope and puts the logic right next to the worker registration call. This makes hard to test the logic inside the anonymous function, but I never test that logic. I treat the functions I register with gearman as controllers. I pass the workload off to a model class that is fully unit tested.\nHere is a nice example:\n\nI would update the Gearman examples on php.net, but I think a lot of people are still using PHP 5.2 (or even earlier).

That is, there were certain decisions made about a language that are less than ideal. Some people are driven to remove these warts from the language in an attempt to make the language better. I think this is done with the best intentions, but can often have negative consequences. JavaScript is a good example of a language that has a lot of warts. Despite all these warts, JavaScript is a very useful language and has seen a huge rise in popularity. I feel PHP is the same way. It has bad parts, but there are so many good parts that we need to celebrate those good parts. Here are a few things off the top of my head:\nArrays\nI think the array is the single most powerful and useful part of PHP. The PHP array is the Swiss Amry knife in my programming toolkit. I have written applications in a number of other software languages and I have yet to find anything else more useful. The best part about arrays is that they just work. I don't have to decide ahead of time between a list or a map. The PHP array is to data structures as NoSQL is to SQL. Better still is that PHP core uses them all over the place. Results from the database: arrays. Parsing a json POST from the client: arrays. They are ubiquitous in PHP in both core and userland. I cannot say enough good things about PHP arrays.\nWeb Ready\nPHP is web ready. I do not mean that PHP is easy to integrate into a webserver. PHP is easy to integrate, but I think a lot of languages do a good job of integrating to webservers now. I mean PHP is built for the web. It is so easy to create an HTML template and pass the data to it. I think Mustache and Twig are great. That being said, I do not have to decide on a templating language in order to get up and running. Everyone understands HTML.\nI do think this is feature is getting less important as the web develops. I write a lot of API's and send almost everything to the client via json. However, they are still tons of websites out there are that are not platforms and need to serve up HTML.\nStreams\nStreams are the best kept secret in PHP. Most people do not even realize they are using streams when they are interacting with file systems or networks. I wrote a plugin to push messages to the Phergie IRC bot in less than an hour using streams. They are a really powerful abstraction that is used all over PHP.\nType Juggling\nFor the most part, a web application is just a bunch of strings. HTTP is all strings, most database adapters return strings and all output is strings. PHP handles all of this and removes all kinds of boilerplate code from my applications. I think PHP has the most sensible implementation of juggling too. Yes, they are some problems with large integers that are represented as strings. It is by no means perfect. However, I think the PHP zval has saved me orders of magnitude more hours than pain.\nFor all the warts, there is plenty of beauty in PHP. I still enjoy writing web applications using PHP and focus my time using the parts of PHP that work really well.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2012/07/16/php-the-good-parts.html/","title":"PHP: The Good Parts"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2012/12/30/do-not-be-afraid-of-new-technology.html/":{"body":"I think the SQL is Agile post by Armin Ronacher is a little short sighted.

At one point there was no such thing as the idea of sharding or master/slave replication. These ideas came about as SQL became more mature. There may be another breakthrough that no one has thought of to scale relational databases. There also may be some breakthroughs with NoSQL datbases that make them scale better than they do now.\nRelational databases have been around since the 1970s and Oracle was started in 1977. There has been a ton of research poured into relational databases. We have the SQL-99 standard and ACID compliance. There are a lot of people using relational databases and they have become very familiar with them over the years. MongoDB was just started a little over 5 years ago. Not as many people have as much knowledge or expierence with MongoDB as they do with something like MySQL because it has not been around as long. To say that you will \"never\" use it again for a project moving forward is the wrong attitude. If you do not feel comfortable with MongoDB, then you should not use it for any sort of serious project. That should not prevent you from using it for toy projects so you can build more experience. Let's face it: document databases have a place in the world and they are not going to go away.\nI think a lot of the problems Armin has with NoSQL, such as adding a new index, will go away. The fact that indices are hard to add or can change the output is a problem that can be solved. That is not a problem inherit with document databases. That is just a pain point of the implementation. The global lock in MongoDB was a huge pain point and it eventually went away. Maybe saying that you \"would never start a project with MongoDB\" is just sensationalism. I believe NoSQL can be used for toy projects if you think the technology is interesting but are not ready to use it on something more serious. That is a great way we can be responsible with approaching new technology.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2012/12/30/do-not-be-afraid-of-new-technology.html/","title":"Do Not Be Afraid Of New Technology"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2013/01/19/datetime-scrum.html/":{"body":"I have always wondered why the MySQL datetime type only has second precision. Developers will happily put a datetime type in a unique index though. They justify that decision by telling themselves, \"Two rows inserted within the same second will never happen\". That same developer just got done reading the latest MongoDB article that benchmarked a gazillion inserts a second. They tweeted it too. I suggest that we use a bigint and store a timestamp with greater precision if we are to use it as a unique index (or use Postgres). \"A bigint takes up too much space!\". Cool guid there, bro. So what does this tangent have to do with scrum? This whole notion of 2-4 week sprints for development is akin to using second precision when a Fusion ioDrive2 can rock 500 million write IOPS.\nI just have this notion in my head that 2-4 week sprints are not condusive to good business. I may be wrong, but 95% of startups fail anyways so you might as well try something different. I prefer 1-2 day iterations. It may sound crazy to break a 4 month project down into 1-2 day iterations, but I think the end result will be significantly better. It distills a project or feature down to what is most important. With 2 week iterations, going through 4 iterations of a product takes 2 months. That feels like a lifetime to me.  The quarter is nearly over by then. I hope your (educated) guess was right because you have almost no time to try something else. I am not even confining this 1-2 day iteration idea to startups either. I think it is more important for larger businesses because they have more to gain (and lose).\nI expect this 1-2 day pace to feel chaotic to most people. Most people want to establish some kind of process so they feel like they have some control. A 2-4 week sprint is great because we now have time to estimate. With estimates we now have visibility into the healthiness of the project through burndown charts and can measure things like team velocity. When did \"team velocity\" suddenly become more important than growing the business? They would rather sit up in the ivory tower and watch Uncle Bob discuss the best practice for the number of lines of a class method instead.\nGrow the business. And stop using MySQL datetime fields in unique indices.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2013/01/19/datetime-scrum.html/","title":"What do MySQL datetime types and scrum have in common?"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2013/02/06/misunderstanding-dry.html/":{"body":"I think the Object Oriented (OO) principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is often misunderstood. In particular, the word \"repeat\" is troublesome. It has nothing to do with minimizing the amount of code you write. It is also not about merging similar methods together into a super-method. The DRY principle is about preserving a single source of truth in a system. When a there are multiple sources of truth in a system we have to write more code to manually keep all the truths in sync with each other. This often leads to unintended consequences to a part of the system when a change is made to a different part of the system. We are left to look through the code looking for these unintended consequences and become increasingly reluctant to change. Properly applying the DRY principle protects us from these unintended consequences and can make our code much more accepting of change.\nTo those less experienced, DRYing up some parts of the code may not seem like a waste of time in the present. I want to use some code samples in an attempt to prove that fixing even simple DRY violations can be very helpful. The following class is a simple Car class.  It starts out with a single method currentSpeed() which returns the current speed of the Car instance. In a real class, there would be more implementation detail. For now we are just concerned with the speed of the Car class. We will change the Car and use the DRY principles to help us design good code.\n\nAt this point the class seems pretty reasonable. The $speed member variable stores the speed of the Car instance. The currentSpeed() method simply returns the speed. Now let us pretend that we need to add the logic for cruise control. A basic cruise control system is made up of four operations: toggle, set, cancel and resume. The toggle operation turns the cruise control on and off. The set operation will determine the speed of the Car object and maintain that speed. The cancel operation instructs the cruise control system to stop maintaining the set speed. The resume operation signals the cruise control system to accelerate to the set speed and then maintain that speed. The toggle operation is uninteresting, so let's start implementing the set operation. We might do something like this:\n\nThis is a simple change, but we actually just violated the DRY principle. The cruiseControlSet() method should not have direct access to the $speed member variable. Good OO design focuses on passing around message (or methods) and not data. The $speed member variable is data. We should use the currentSpeed() method to ask for the speed. I made a special point to use the word ask in the previous sentence. Our current implementation is not asking for anything. It knows how the $speed data is stored within Car class. What is the big deal though, right? It is obvious by looking at this code that two different methods are accessing $speed. If we are going to change how $speed works later on, we can deal with it then. YAGNI bro!\nTrying to predict the future is sure way to make your code design overly complex. The principle of You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) addresses this concern. However, we have already established a pattern here. More than one method needs to know the speed of the Car object. There is a good chance that more methods will need to know the speed as well. It is also important to consider the cost of making a change. In this case, the cost of changing cruiseControlSet() to use the currentSpeed() method instead of directly accessing $speed is very low. When the cost is low, err on the side of good OO design in an attempt to make change easy. Do it even if you are sure that $speed will never change.\nSomething else starts to become apparent as we add more of the cruise control functionality to the Car class. Let's add the other methods and see if we can spot it.\n\nAs we are adding the cruise control functionality to the Car class something starts to feel wrong. The class is getting large in a hurry. Also, our tests may be getting harder to setup. This functionality is screaming to be refactored into a separate class. Another hint is that we started using a common method prefix of cruiseControl. Whenever this happens, we should really consider if this functionality is part of this class. Let's move all the cruiseControl*() methods and the cruisingSpeed() method into another class. Watch closely how the DRY principle helps us minimize the amount of changes we make in this refactor.\n\nNotice how the methods that implement our cruise control operations are still using the currentSpeed() method. They did not have to change because we just added a protected method to get the current speed of the car. We hide away the knowledge of where the speed is coming from as these methods are not concerned with that specific knowledge. We are able to do this because the cruise control is given access to the public interface of the Car class and can then determine the speed. This forces the cruise control system to ask the Car class to do things. For example, the cruise control system no longer has the potential to change the $speed of the Car class. If it wants to change speeds, it must ask a Car object to accelerate or decelerate.\nI hope I have shown the benefits of DRYing up code, even when the DRY violations appear to be harmless. You may still have some reservations about the benefits of the DRY principle. I encourage you to put the those reservations aside for a period of time and adhere to those principles. Chances are you will notice an increase in the quality of design.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2013/02/06/misunderstanding-dry.html/","title":"Misunderstanding DRY"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2013/03/16/dry-and-clean-interfaces.html/":{"body":"The principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is more than just grouping common code together.

Here is one version of code reuse:\n{% highlight objective-c %}\n\n\n(NSString *)generateFlickrImageUrl:(NSDictionary *)photo withImageType:(NSString *) imageType\n{\nNSString *imageSize;\nif ([imageType isEqualToString:@\"thumbnail\"]) {\nimageSize = @\"t\";\n} else {\nimageSize = @\"z\";\n}\nNSString *farm = [photo valueForKey:@\"farm\"];\nNSString *server = [photo valueForKey:@\"server\"];\nNSString *photoId = [photo valueForKey:@\"id\"];\nNSString *secret = [photo valueForKey:@\"secret\"];\nNSString *url = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"http://farm%@.staticflickr.com/%@/%@%@%@.jpg\", farm, server, photoId, secret, imageSize];\nreturn url;\n}\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\nWhile this does reuse code, it is bad because the code is not accepting of change. If I have to add some other sort of image type, then I have to modify this function. This is a big red flag. When you start using method parameters as an extension of your interface, you may be making the code hard to change.

So that's fun, everyone who thought you knew what you were doing.— Nate Abele (@nateabele) January 3, 2014\n\nThis post is not intended to present the best way to design and build hypermedia services. My goal is present a high level description of how we have built and designed a hypermedia API at HauteLook within the context of the MVC Architectual Pattern. That being said, I am always looking for ways to improve.\nLet's start with the controller. According to the Gang of Four, the controller \"defines the way the user interface reacts to user input\". In the context of a hypermedia service, user input comes in the form of a request. The request is most commonly sent using HTTP, but could use another protocol such as FTP. We will be assuming HTTP for the rest of this post. The user interface is the API response the server sends back to the client. In a hypermedia API, the response is based on which resources the client (user) is requesting and what media type the client prefers.\nLet us use the example below. We can assume that the client is knowledgeable of the /users/42 URL because it made a HTTP GET request to / and received a list of user relations it can then request.\n\nThe controller will first fetch the user resource. If successful, the controller will specify a 200 response code, any necessary headers and then pass that resource to the view along with the desired client's desired media type. However, there are many reasons why the request may not be successful. The resource /users/42 may not exist, the client may not be authorized to make the request, pre-conditions of the request may not be satisifed or any other number of problems. In any of those error cases, the controller will issue the proper response code, headers and any body necessary to represent the current state to the client.\nThe resources in our hypermedia API are models. We have some code samples of models for address and user resources below. I chose ruby as it makes the code very concise. How exactly these models are populated is an exercise left up to the reader. What we do not want to do is simply transfer the data in our persistence layer (i.e. database) directly to the client. If we are using something like a relational database, there may be many tables required to accurately represent one resource. Take a look at the Address model below. We may need to execute a SQL statement that joins some hypothetical addresses, states and countries tables together in order to create address resources. Our goal is to encapsulate the resources you want to represent to the client. If the underlying persistence layer changes, the resource should not change.\n\nOnce we have our resources created, we need to represent them to the client using the view. The view is only concerned with how we are presenting our resource to the client. It is not scalable to explicitly write out every resource/media-type combination. We want to describe how to represent a resource in an agnostic way. We then feed those descriptions into a serializer that is aware of HAL, Atom, JSON-API, etc and can generate the output based on the desired media type of the client.\nHere is an example DSL that describes how to represent a user resource to the client:\n\nThe user class is serialized into the correct media type based on the description. The relations section describes how the user relates to other resources in the API. The properties section describes how to show the resource to the client. In this case, we do not show first and last name separate properties but instead show one name property. More importantly, we do not include the user_id in the response. It is probably not important to the client what the user id is, except to create URLs. We have the relations to avoid client-side URL generation though. Also, notice how the addresses are embedded in the representation of a user. The serializer would look up how to represent the address and serialize it accordingly.\nThe above DSL is loosely based on the Symfony 2 HATEOAS bundle that we use at HauteLook. Reading through the documentation you may notice that it uses funky PHP annotations. This is just a preference of the maintainers. There is also built-in support to use separate PHP or XML files to describe the view.\nThis architecture has made it fairly straight-forward to design and maintain a hypermedia API. The risk of changes at persistent layer leaking into the client representations is low. The models encapsulate the resources and we can make them as resistant to change as we want. The view presents the representation of the resource and how the resource relates to other resources to the client.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2014/01/04/hypermedia-services-and-mvc.html/","title":"Hypermedia Services and MVC"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2014/03/21/testing-repeated-elements-with-behat-mink.html/":{"body":"The Mink extension to behat makes it really easy to test the contents of a page.

After talking with a few colleagues, I decided to create a feature that allowed me to do this. Here is an example of my feature syntax:\n{% highlight gherkin %}\nThen I should see the following in the repeated \"div.item-row-name\" element within the context of the \"div.items\" element:\n| text   |\n| Item 1 |\n| Item 2 |\n| Item 3 |\n{% endhighlight %}\nHere is what the code looks like:\n{% highlight php %}\n[^\"]*)\" element within the context of the \"(?P[^\"]*)\" element\n*/\npublic function assertRepeatedElementContainsText(TableNode $table, $element, $parentElement)\n{\n    $parent = $this-&gt;getSession()-&gt;getPage()-&gt;findAll('css', $parentElement);\n\n    foreach ($table-&gt;getHash() as $n =&gt; $repeatedElement) {\n        $child = $parent[$n];\n\n        \\PHPUnit_Framework_Assert::assertEquals(\n            $child-&gt;find('css', $element)-&gt;getText(),\n            $repeatedElement['text']\n        );\n    }\n}\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nI take advantage of the fact that the repeated elements have a common parent `div.items`. I find all children of the `div.items` element using the Mink `find` API. I can loop over the children and take advantage of the fact that the children are of type `NodeElement`. The `NodeElement` class shares the same base class as `DocumentElement` object returned from `$this-&gt;getSession()-&gt;getPage()` call. When I use the `find` method on the `$child` object, I will only search for elements that are within the context of the current child. Here is what that context looks like on the first iteration:\n\n{% highlight html %}\n\n    Item 1\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nNow when I search for the element matching `div.item-row-name`, I only get back the _one_ element within this context. I can then assert that this text within this element matches the corresponding item in my table.\n\nNotice that I use a PHPUnit assertion within this feature. I would have preferred to re-use an existing Mink web assertion, but all of the assertions assume a global context. Look at the [elementTextContains]() code to see what I mean.\n\nHappy Hacking!\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2014/03/21/testing-repeated-elements-with-behat-mink.html/","title":"Testing Repeated Elements With Behat+Mink"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2014/03/27/emberconf-2014.html/":{"body":"My notes from Emberconf.\nOpening Keynote\nOpen source communities value contributions that are not just code. --- Yehuda Katz\n\nRobert Jackson contributed a lot of works to making the 6 week release process much more automated.\nA number of people worked to create ember-cli tooling.\nJo Liss created Broccoli.\nLeah Silber organized Emberconf.\n\nI believe a successful team requires more than just someone who writes the primary code. It requires meta-contributions that make the environment and culture excellent. This is my vision for the HauteLook team and embraces concepts, such as DevOps, as first class citizens of the process.\nEmphasis on screens and flows\n\nYehuda referenced a Basecamp blog post A shorthand for designing UI flows to emphasize the need to focusing on flows now that Ember has first-class URL support.\n\nThis was a call to action to start thinking differently about building web applications. The github website was used to demonstrate the complexity of web applications. The github website puts a lot of information on a single screen and uses flows within that screen to organize the experience. There are often flows within flows and we need to start documenting all the states to manage the complexity.\nA later talk, given by Nathan Hammond introduced ember-flow which used a digraph to manage state transitions within an application. Nathan argued that it is our responsibility as application developers not to pollute the browser history with unnecessary transitions of state. To prevent this, he recommended the use of replaceWith instead of transitionTo.\nEmber Components\nRyan Florence gave an inspiring talk about Ember Components. He demonstrateded a number of components that he has built for instructure. Ryan provided some sage wisdom for component design:\n\nGood components usually do not have a template. If your component does have a template, consider breaking it down into multiple components. Ryan used &lt;select&gt;&lt;option /&gt;&lt;/select&gt; as an example of good component design. The select and option tags are separate components that are related to each other. The select tag may be aware of which option tag is currently selected.\nCreate a component that groups small components together. Ryan's ic-tabs component groups together many small components together to make it easier for others to use.\nThe child should inform the parent when it is present. Do not make the parent poll for children components. Ryan used the &lt;form&gt; tag as an example of how this should work. A form can exist on its own. When adding a &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt; tag to the form, the button informs form.\n\nDistributed Computing\nChristopher Meiklejohn from Basho gave a very dense, but inspiring talk on distributed computing. The main take-away was that ember-data is trying to solve a problem of distrbuted computing.\n\nthinkdistributed.io - Christopher hosts a podcast that is a great introduction to the concepts of distributed computing.\nhttps://syncfree.lip6.fr - Christopher is part of an EU project that is trying to solve \"Large-scale computation without synchronisation\".\n\nEmber Performance\nMatthew Beale discussed Ember performance. His book Developing an Ember Edge takes a deeper look into creating performant Ember applications. The main take-away was that a lot of the performance issues may not be related to JavaScript. Look at how the network and the browser painting (animations, rendering) are affecting performance. Ready High Performance Browser Networking for more insight into how to diagnose and resolve network issues.\nMatthew did point out that observers are actually a synchronous operation. Expensive functions that are observing a property should be handled with care. He suggested the use of setProperties, Ember.run.once and pushObjects to work around performance issues. Yehuda commented that the core team considers the synchronous nature of observers a bug, but it is hard to fix without breaking existing Ember 1.0 compatibility.\nOther Links Related To Talks\n\nBroccoli: First Beta Release - Broccoli is an awesome build tool created by Jo Liss.\nThe Extensible Web Manifesto was part of the closing keynote given by David Herman\n\nSketches of Talks\nMichael Chan sketched notes from each talk.

The stated goal of the nickel.rs framework is to show people that it can be easy to write web servers using a sytems language like Rust. I have been using the framework to create hypermredia examples using my hal-rs library.\nOne of the downsides to a systems language like Rust is the verbosity of the syntax. Someone used to writing in Python or Ruby may be in for quite a shock. I started really feeling this when writing route handlers used by nickel. Here is the simple example from the docs:\n\nNotice the _request variable has a leading underscore. This tells the compiler not to throw a warning if this variable is unused. If you do decided to use _request later on, then you need to remember to change the variable name to request. You also need to make a name for the function so it can be referenced in the call to server.get. This sort of boilerplate stuff is not what I want to spend time worrying about. What I really want is a nice looking DSL to describe my routes.\nAfter some perusing of the provided examples in nickel.rs, I discovered the router! macro. We can use the router! macro to get a DSL-like syntax for routing. Here is the same example above using the router! macro:\n\nWhen we use the router! macro, it expands into the same Rust code as in our first example. We don't have to think of a name for the function, worry about type of request or response or or type out the server.get line. If you want to see the router! macro used in a real world example, check out the index response from my hal-rs-demo web server. The code for the router! macro is here.\nThe jury is still out on whether or not nickel.rs, or even Rust itself, will be suitable for creating web servers that serve up API responses and HTML to clients.

This is currently not implemented in Rust though. I decided to read up on The Foreign Function Interface Guide to figure out how to do it myself. The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is how Rust code interfaces with native C code. I also found a great Stack Overflow post that showed me how to write native C to get the terminal size. Based on my research, I needed to do three things in order to get my terminal size:\n\nCreate a winsize struct in Rust.\nUse or externalize the ioctl C function.\nUse or externalize the STDOUT_FILENO and TIOCGWINSZ constants.\n\nWinsize Struct\nCreating the winsize struct in Rust is pretty straight forward as Rust has structs too. I first needed to find the definition of winsize in C, so I did some googling and found the sys/ioctl.h source. When defining the struct, we must tell Rust to represent the struct as a C struct using #[repr(C)]. If you read the FFI Guide, then you may be wondering about #[repr(C, packed)]. I talk about packing in more detail at the end of the post. The struct members within winsize are all unsigned short. The C unsigned short is represented in Rust as c_ushort in the libc Rust module. We now have:\n\nioctl\nNow I need to figure out what to do about the ioctl function. Checking out the Rust docs leads me to the ioctl function signature but I notice that this signature does not look like a variadic function (no varargs). I guess I have to externalize it in my code as a variadic function. I decided to check the Rust source to see if I could find an example of a variadic function and I stumbled in the definition of ioctl. This definition is variadic, so I guess rustdoc does not show this. Strange.\nI have read that ws_xpixel and ws_ypixel are not used. I also have no use for them. I still opted to include them in my struct definition as I have no idea what ioctl is doing to that struct.\nI have used this word externalized a few times already, so maybe I should now define it. To externalize something is to make that somethings C representation accessible to Rust code. You normally do this with function signatures, constants and global variables. Note that we did not externalize winsize, but instead copied the definition from C to Rust. We cannot externalize winsize as Rust needs to directly manage the definition and memory related to that struct.\nThe Constants\nFinally, I need to deal with my constants. I was pretty sure STDOUT_FILENO would already be in Rust. Sure enough, libc::STDOUT_FILENO exists. I was not so lucky with TIOCGWINSZ. The TIOCGWINSZ constant acts as a command to ioctl. If you read the source of sys/ioctl.h, you will notice the value of the commands is based on some rules that encode information to ioctl. There is a fair amount of bit twiddling going on to generate these values. Even if we do the bitwise math by hand, we should still check our work. To do that, I wrote a simple C program that would tell us the proper hex value of TIOCGWINSZ:\n\nUsing this value I can create the same constant in Rust:\n\nPutting It All Together\nMy function for get_winsize now looks like this:\n\nI initialize my variable containing a winsize struct with values of zero, just like I would memset(w, 0, sizeof(winsize)) in C. In order to use the externalized ioctl function, we have to wrap the code in unsafe {} blocks. This informs Rust this code is not to be checked by the compiler for safety. The ioctl function follows the C convention of returning a 0 for success and a -1 for an error. If an error occurs, I decided to throw an existing IoResult error already in Rust. I need to spend a little more time to externalize the errno global variable in C so I can get the exact error. If the function is successful, I return the width and height as a tuple.\nHere is a gist of the complete program, including a simple test. This puts all the peices discussed above together and will properly calculate the terminal window size when executed.\nTo Pack Or Not\nIf you see a struct defined with __attribute__((__packed__)) then you need to use #[repr(C, packed)]. Example:\n```c`\nstruct attribute((packed)) foo {\nchar first;\nint second;\n};\n\nis not 5 bytes in size, but 8 bytes due to padding. Here is how the same struct looks after the compiler has added padding:\n\nI found a Stack Overflow post the explains it in even greater detail.

Writing what seemed like a simple getter function caused me a lot of frustration. The self parameter can really throw me off in Rust. I reflexively treat it like this in C++, which has no concept of &amp; or &amp;mut. I do this because I think of impl Person as defining methods on a class as I would do in C++. This can be really misleading.\nConsider this Ruby code that we want to port to Rust:\n\nIn Rust this would look something like:\n\nI run rustc --test person.rs, everything compiles and things are looking good. Even the test passes. What happens if I want to use p again though? If I modify my test to call .get_name() again I receive a cryptic error:\n\n\nI read about ownership in the Rust Book and recall some of what moved means, but it is not clear where to go from here. What many people new to Rust do is resort to using .clone(), but even that will not satisfy the compiler. Thinking back to C++, using a reference makes sense! Let's changing the first parameter to .get_name() from self to &amp;self:\n\nWhenever I see the word borrowed I know the compiler is referring to someething that is being passed by reference. In this case &amp;self is being passed by reference. The compiler is trying to tell me that it cannot move ownership of name from my borrowed &amp;self. I do not want to give up ownership of name though. I simply want my test to have access to the value for a little while. So, the next step is to return a reference to a String, via &amp;String, so ownership doesn't change. Compiling that shows me:\n\nThis sort of error is very familar in Rust. Turning self.name into a reference via &amp;self.name makes everything compile and leaves us with:\n\nComparison to C++\nWhat made things really click for me is to think about how references work in C++.

I have been thinking about the way we design code in the web world versus the way we design code in Rust. In the web world, we often use a hash/dict/map to hide hard-coded values behind a nicer interface. Consider an example where you would want to write a function to create the escape sequence for colors in a TTY terminal. You might write something like this in Ruby:\n\nThe foreground and the background color codes are accessed by passing in the names of the color as a symbol via color(:black, :white). If you tried to port this code directly into Rust, you would run into a few problems. First, there are no symbols in Rust. You might think to work around this by using strings instead of symbols. Then you start looking at the documentation for a HashMap and realize maps are quite a bit more involved than in Ruby. After fighting with the syntax for a while, you may come to the conclusion that Rust is too difficult of a language for you to figure out. There is a better way.\nRust has a really powerful feature called enums. Here is that same code using an enum:\n\nYou can call the color method via color(ANSIColor::black, ANSIColor::white);. There is a complete, working example on playpen.\nI think the use of enums in that code is really expressive. Even more so than ruby: color(:black, :white). The Rust enum provides the context of what black or white mean to the color function.  This also has the benefit of being type-checked by the compiler. If you or anyone else tries to specify a color like ANSIColor::pink the compiler would generate an error for you. This removes the pain of checking for valid colors at runtime, handling those errors at runtime and writing tests around those use-cases. This compile-time checking is what makes Rust such a powerful language.\nThere are plenty of cases for using dicts/hashes/maps in Rust. However, if you find yourself writing a function that accepts a finite set of options, then I suggest trying to use a Rust enum before resorting to a HashMap.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/04/18/replace-dicts-with-rust-enums.html/","title":"Replace Dicts With Rust Enums"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/03/string-vs-str-in-rust-functions.html/":{"body":"\n\n\nRussian Translation\nFor all the people frustrated by having to use to_string() to get programs to compile this post is for you. For those not quite understanding why Rust has two string types String and &amp;str, I hope to shed a little light on the matter.\nFunctions That Accept A String\nI want to discuss how to build interfaces that accept strings. I am an avid hypermedia fan and am obsessed about designing interfaces that are easy to use. Let's start with a method that accepts a String. Our search hints that std::string::String is a good choice here.\n\nThis gives a compiler error:\n\nSo a string literal is of type &amp;str and does not appear compatible with the type String. We can change the message type to a String and compile succesfully: let message = \"hello world\".to_string();. This works, but it is analogous to using clone() to get around ownership/borrowing errors. Here are three reasons to change print_me to accept a &amp;str instead:\n\nThe &amp; symbol is a reference type and means we are borrowing the variable. When print_me is done with the variable, ownership will return to the original owner. Unless we have good reason to move ownership of the message variable into our function, we should elect to borrow.\nUsing a reference is more efficient. Using String for message means the program must copy the value. When using a reference, such as &amp;str, no copy is made.\nA String type can be magically turned into a &amp;str type using the Deref trait and type coercion. This will make more sense with an example.\n\nExample of Deref Coercion\nThis example creates strings in four different ways that all work with the print_me function. The key to making this all work is passing values by reference. Rather than passing owned_string as a String to print_me, we instead pass it as &amp;String. When the compiler sees a &amp;String being passed to a function that takes &amp;str, it coerces the &amp;String into a &amp;str. This same coercion takes places for the reference counted and atomically referenced counted strings. The string variable is already a reference, so no need to use a &amp; when calling print_me(string). Knowing this, we no longer need to have .to_string() calls littering our code.\n\nYou can also use Deref coercion with other types, such as a Vector. After all, a String is just a vector of 8-byte chars. Read more about Deref coercions in the Rust lang book.\nIntroducing struct\nAt this point we should be free of extraneous to_string() calls for our functions. However, we run into some problems when we try to introduce a struct. Using what we just learned, we might make a struct like this:\n\nWe get the error:\n\nRust is trying to ensure that Person does not outlive the reference to name. If Person did manage to outlive name, then we risk our program crashing. The whole point of Rust is to prevent this. So let's start trying to get this code to compile. We need to specify a lifetime, or scope, so Rust can keep us safe. The conventional lifetime specifier is 'a. I do not know why that was picked, but let's go with that.\n\nCompile again and we get another error:\n\nLet's think about this. We know we want to hint to the Rust compiler that our struct Person should not outlive name. So, we need to delcare our lifetime on the Person struct. Some searching will point us to &lt;'a&gt; being the syntax to declare lifetimes.\n\nThis compiles! We normally implement methods on our structs though. Let's add a greet function to our Person class.\n\nWe now get the error:\n\nOur Person struct has a lifetime paremeter so our implementation should have it too. Let's declare our 'a lifetime to the implementation of Person like impl Person&lt;'a&gt; {. Unfortunately, this gives us a confusing error when we compile:\n\nIn order for us to declare the lifetime, we need to specify the lifetime right after the impl like impl&lt;'a&gt; Person {. Compile again and we get the error:\n\nNow we are back on track. Let's add back our lifetime parameter back to the implementation of Person like impl&lt;'a&gt; Person&lt;'a&gt; {. Now our program compiles. Here is the complete working code:\n\nString or &amp;str In struct\nThe question is now whether to use a String or a &amp;str in your struct. In other words when should we use a reference to another type in a struct? We should use a reference if our struct does not need ownership of the variable. This concept might be a little vague, but there are some rules I use to get at an answer.\n\nDo I need to use the variable outside of my struct? Here is a contrived example:\n\n\nI should use a reference here since I need to use the variable later. Here is a real-world example in rustc_serialize. The Encoder struct does not need to own the writer variable that implements std::fmt::Write, just use (borrow) it for a little while. In fact, String implements Write. In this example using the encode function, the variable of type String is passed to the Encoder and then returned to the caller of encode.\n\nIs my type large? If the type is large, then passing it by reference will save unncessary memory usage. Remember, passing by reference does not cause a copy of the variable. Consider a String buffer that contains a large amount of data. Copying that around will cause the program to be much slower.\n\nWe should now be able to create functions that accept strings whether they are &amp;str, String or event reference counted. We are also able to create structs that are able to have variables that are references. The lifetime of the struct is linked to those referenced variables to make sure that the struct does not outlive the referenced variable and caused bad things to happen in our program. We also have a initial understanding of whether or not the varibles in our struct should be types or references to types.\nWhat about 'static\nRandom aside, but I thought it worth mentioning. We can use a 'static lifetime to get our original example to compile, but I caution against it:\n\nThe 'static lifetime is valid for the entire program. You may not need Person or name to live that long.\nRelated\n\nCreating a Rust function that accepts String or &amp;str\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/03/string-vs-str-in-rust-functions.html/","title":"String vs &str in Rust functions"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/06/creating-a-rust-function-that-accepts-string-or-str.html/":{"body":"\n\n\nRussian Translation\nIn my last post we talked a lot about using &amp;str as the preferred type for functions accepting a string argument. Towards the end of that post there was some discussion about when to use String vs &amp;str in a struct. I think this advice is good, but there are cases where using &amp;str instead of String is not optimal. We need another strategy for these use cases.\nA struct Containing Strings\nConsider the Person struct below. For the sake of discussion, let's say Person has a real need to own the name variable. We choose to use the String type instead of &amp;str.\n\nNow we need to implement a new() function. Based on my last blog post, we prefer a &amp;str:\n\nThis works as long as we remember to call .to_string() inside of the new() function. However, the ergonomics of this function are less than desired. If we use a string literal, then we can make a new Person like Person.new(\"Herman\"). If we already have a String though, we need to ask for a reference to the String:\n\nIt feels like we are going in circles though. We had a String, then we called as_ref() to turn it into a &amp;str only to then turn it back into a String inside of the new() function. We could go back to using a String like fn new(name: String) -&gt; Person {, but that means we need to force the caller to use .to_string() whenever there is a string literal.\nInto conversions\nWe can make our function easier for the caller to work with by using the Into trait. This trait will can automatically convert a &amp;str into a String. If we already have a String, then no conversion happens.\n\nThis syntax for new() looks a little different. We are using Generics and Traits to tell Rust that some type S must implement the trait Into for type String. The String type implements Into&lt;String&gt; as noop because we already have a String. The &amp;str type implements Into&lt;String&gt; by using the same .to_string() method we were originally doing in the new() function. So we aren't side-stepping the need for the .to_string() call, but we are taking away the need for the caller to do it. You might wonder if using Into&lt;String&gt; hurts performance and the answer is no. Rust uses static dispatch and the concept of monomorphization to handle all this during the compiler phase.\nDon't worry if things like static dispatch and monomorphization are confusing. You just need to know that using the syntax above you can create functions that accept both String and &amp;str. If you are thinking that fn new&lt;S: Into&lt;String&gt;&gt;(name: S) -&gt; Person { is a lot of syntax, it is. It is important to point out though that there is nothing special about Into&lt;String&gt;. It is just a trait that is part of the Rust standard library. You could implement this trait yourself if you wanted to. You can implement similar traits you find useful and publish them on crates.io. All this userland power is what makes Rust an awesome language.\nAnother Way To Write Person::new()\nThe where syntax also works and may be easier to read, especially if the function signature becomes more complex:\n\nRelated\n\nString vs &amp;str in Rust functions\nCreating a Rust function that returns a &amp;str or String\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/06/creating-a-rust-function-that-accepts-string-or-str.html/","title":"Creating a Rust function that accepts String or &str"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/29/creating-a-rust-function-that-returns-string-or-str.html/":{"body":"\n\n\nRussian Translation\nWe learned how to create a function that accepts String or &amp;str as an argument. Now I want to show you how to create a function that returns either String or &amp;str. I also want to discuss why we would want to do this. To start, let us write a function to remove all the spaces from a given string. Our function might look something like this:\n\nThis function allocates memory for a string buffer, loops through each character of input and appends all non-space characters to the string buffer. Now I ask: what if my input did not contain spaces at all? The value input would be the same as buf. In that case, it would be more efficient to not create buf in the first place. Instead, we would like to just return the given input back to the caller. The type of input is a &amp;str but our function returns a String though. We could change the type of input to a String:\n\nbut this causes two problems. First, by making input of type String we are forcing the caller to move the ownership of input into our function. This prevents the caller from using that value in the future. We should only take ownership of input if we actually need it. Second, the input might already be of type &amp;str and we are now forcing the caller to convert it into a String which defeats our attempts to not allocate new memory when creating buf.\nClone-on-write\nWhat we really want is the ability to return our input string (&amp;str) if there are no spaces and to return a new string (String) if there are spaces we need to remove. This is where the clone-on-write or Cow type can be used. The Cow type allows us to abstract away whether something is Owned or Borrowed. In our example, the &amp;str is a reference to an existing string so that would be borrowed data. If there are spaces, then we need to allocate memory for a new String. That new String is owned by the buf variable. Normally, we would move the ownership of buf by returning it to the caller. When using Cow, we want to move the ownership of buf into the Cow type and return that.\n\nOur function now checks to see if the given input contains a space and only then allocates memory for a new buffer. If the input does not contain a space, the input is simply returned. We are adding a bit of runtime complexity to optimize how we allocate memory. Notice that our Cow type has the same lifetime of the &amp;str type. As we discussed previously, the compiler needs to track the &amp;str reference to know when it can safely free (or Drop) the memory.\nThe beauty of Cow is that it implements the Deref trait so you can call immutable functions without knowing whether or not the result is a new string buffer or not. Example:\n\nIf I do need to mutate s, then I can convert it into an owned variable using the into_owned() function. If the variant of Cow was already Owned then we are simply moving ownership. If the variant of Cow is Borrowed, then we are allocating memory. This allows us to lazily clone (allocate memory) only when we want to write (or mutate) the variable.\nExample where a Cow::Borrowed is mutated:\n\nExample where a Cow::Owned is mutated:\n\nThe idea behind Cow is two-fold:\n\nDelay the allocation of memory for as long as possible. In the best case, we never have to allocate any new memory.\nAllow the caller of our remove_spaces function to not care if memory was allocated or not. The usage of the Cow type is the same in either case.\n\nLeveraging the Into Trait\nWe previously discussed using the Into trait to convert a &amp;str into a String. We can also use the Into trait to convert the &amp;str or String into the proper Cow variant. By calling .into() the compiler will perform the conversion automatically. Using .into() will not speed up or slow down the code. It is simply an option to avoid having to specify Cow::Owned or Cow::Borrowed explicitly.\n\nWe can also clean this up a bit using just iterators:\n\nReal World Uses of Cow\nMy example of removing spaces may seem a bit contrived, but there are some great real-world applications of this strategy. Inside of Rust core there is a function that converts bytes to UTF-8 in a lossy manner and a function that will translate CRLF to LF. Both of these functions have a case where a &amp;str can be returned in the optimal case and another case where a String has to be allocated. Other examples I can think of are properly encoding an xml/html string or properly escaping a SQL query. In many cases, the input is already properly encoded or escaped. In those cases, it is better to just return the input string back to the caller. When the input does need to be modified we are forced to allocate new memory, in the form of a String buffer, and return that to the caller.\nWhy use String::with_capacity() ?\nWhile we are on the topic of efficient memory management, notice that I used String::with_capacity() instead of String::new() when creating the string buffer. You can use String::new() instead of String::with_capacity(), but it is more efficient to allocate memory for the buffer all at once instead of re-allocating memory as we push more chars onto the buffer. Let us walk through what Rust does when we use String::new() and then push characters onto the string.\nA String is really a Vec of UTF-8 code points. When String::new() is called, Rust creates a vector with zero bytes of capacity. If we then push the character a onto the string buffer, like input.push('a') , Rust has to increase the capacity of the vector. In this case, it will allocate 2 bytes of memory. As we push more characters and exceed the capacity, Rust will double the size of the string by re-allocating memory. It will continue to double the size each time the capacity is exceeded. The sequence of memory allocation is 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ... 2^n where n is the number of times Rust detected that capacity was exceeded. Re-allocating memory is really slow (edit: kmc_v3 explained that it might not be as slow as I thought). Not only does Rust have to ask the kernel for new memory, it must also copy the contents of the vector from the old memory space to the new memory space. Check out the source code for Vec::push to see the resizing logic first-hand.\nIn general, we want to allocate new memory only when we need it and only allocate as much as we need. For small strings, like remove_spaces(\"Herman Radtke\"), the overheard of re-allocating memory is not a big deal. What if I wanted to remove all of the spaces in each JavaScript file for my website? The overhead of re-allocating memory for a buffer is much higher. When pushing data onto a vector (String or otherwise) it can be a good idea to specify a capacity to start with. The best situation is when you already know the length and the capacity can be exactly set. The code comments for Vec give a similar warning.\nRelated\n\nString vs &amp;str in Rust functions\nCreating a Rust function that accepts String or &amp;str\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/05/29/creating-a-rust-function-that-returns-string-or-str.html/","title":"Creating a Rust function that returns a &str or String"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/06/09/strategies-for-solving-cannot-move-out-of-borrowing-errors-in-rust.html/":{"body":"The rules around references and borrowing in Rust are fairly straight-forward. Given an owned variable, we are allowed to have as many immutable references to that variable as we want. Rust defaults to immutability, so even functions like trim are written in such a way that the result is a reference to the original string:\n\nThe only caveat is that I cannot move the name variable anymore. If I try to move name, the compiler will give me an error: cannot move out of name because it is borrowed.\n\nThe compiler knows that trimmed_name is a reference to name. As long as trimmed_name is still in scope, the compiler will not let us pass name to a function, reassign it or do any other move operation. We could clone() the name variable and then trim it, but we really just want to let the compiler know when we are done borrowing name. The key word here is scope. If the reference to name goes out of scope, the compiler will let us move name because it is no longer being borrowed. Let us wrap the call to trim() in curly braces to denote a different scope.\n\nThat is simple enough, but let us take it a step further. Suppose we wanted to get back the length of the trimmed string from within our scope. If we do that inside our curly braces, then trimmed_name_len will no longer exist once we leave that scope.\n\nStrategies\nThere are a few ways to deal with this. They all look pretty similar, but have different trade-offs. We can return the value from a scoped block of code:\n\nThis is a cheap and quick way to force the reference to go out of scope. It does not require us to specify parameters or their types nor does it require us to specify the return type. It is not reusable though. We can get some more reuse if we use an anonymous function (or closure):\n\nA closure requires us to specify parameters and their types, but makes specifying the return type optional. The way this is written, the anonymous function f is only usable within the function scope. If we want complete reusuability we can use a normal function:\n\nThese strategies only work if we are calling immutable functions. We are temporarily keeping the reference to get some other peice of information. This works really well that information is something like implements the Copy trait, such as numbers or booleans. If we wanted to do something like remove all spaces on a string like \"H e r m a n\" then we are mutating the string. We would have to call name.clone() in order to later move the original name variable.\nClosure Without Parameters\nYou may have wondered if we really did have to specify parameters when using a closure. If we try to access the name variable from within the closure, it will create a reference during compile time. That reference will continue to exist, even if we try to remove the closure f from scope. Example:\n\n\nReal World Example\nThe above examples are pretty contrived. However, you will run into this when you are breaking down functions into smaller parts. In this below example, I was using a find_matches function that required an input of type &amp;str. Given a PathBuf, I needed to call the immutable file_name() method on it and then convert it to a &amp;str by calling to_str() before calling find_matches(file_name). In order to return a tuple of (p, matches), I had to make sure reference created by file_name was out of scope. I chose to use a function, but could have use curly braces or a closure as we discussed above.\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/06/09/strategies-for-solving-cannot-move-out-of-borrowing-errors-in-rust.html/","title":"Strategies for solving 'cannot move out of' borrowing errors in Rust"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/06/22/effectively-using-iterators-in-rust.html/":{"body":"In Rust, you quickly learn that vector and slice types are not iterable themselves. Depending on which tutorial or example you see first, you call .iter() or .into_iter(). If you do not realize both of these functions exist or that they do different things, you may find yourself fighting with the compiler to get your code to work. Let us take a journey through the world of iterators and figure out the differences between iter() and into_iter() in Rust.\nIter\nMost examples I have found use .iter(). We can call v.iter() on something like a vector or slice. This creates an Iter&lt;'a, T&gt; type and it is this Iter&lt;'a, T&gt; type that implements the Iterator trait and allows us to call functions like .map(). It is important to note that this Iter&lt;'a, T&gt; type only has a reference to T. This means that calling v.iter() will create a struct that borrows from v. Use the iter() function if you want to iterate over the values by reference.\nLet us write a simple map/reduce example:\n\nIn this example, we are using .map() and .fold() to count the number of bytes (not characters! Rust strings are UTF-8) for all strings in the names vector. We know that the len() function can use an immutable reference. As such, we prefer iter() instead of iter_mut() or into_iter(). This allows us to move the names vector later if we want. I put a bogus use_names_for_something() function in the example just to prove this. If we had used into_iter() instead, the compiler would have given us an error: use of moved value: names response.\nThe closure used in map() does not require the name parameter to have a type, but I specified the type to show how it is being passed as a reference. Notice that the type of name is &amp;&amp;str and not &amp;str. The string \"Jane\" is of type &amp;str. The iter() function creates an iterator that has a reference to each element in the names vector. Thus, we have a reference to a reference of a string slice. This can get a little unwieldy and I generally do not worry about the type. However, if we are destructuring the type, we do need to specify the reference:\n\nIn the above example, the compiler will complain that we are specifying the type (_, _) instead of &amp;(_, _). Changing the pattern to &amp;(player, _score) will satisfy the compiler.\nRust is immutable by default and iterators make it easy to manipulate data without needing mutability. If you do find yourself wanting to mutate some data, you can use the iter_mut() method to get a mutable reference to the values. Example use of iter_mut():\n\nHere we are using a mutable reference to sort the list of players on each team by highest score. The sort_by() function performs the sorting of the Vector/slice in place. This means we need the ability to mutate team in order to sort. I do not use .iter_mut() often, but sometimes functions like .sort_by() provide no immutable alternative.\nI tend to use .iter() most. I try to be very concious and deliberate about when I move resources and default to borrowing (or referencing) first. The reference created by .iter() is short-lived, so we can move or use our original value afterwards. If you find yourself running into does not live long enough, move errors or using the .clone() function, this is a sign that you probably want to use .into_iter() instead.\nIntoIter\nUse the into_iter() function when you want to move, instead of borrow, your value. The .into_iter() function creates a IntoIter&lt;T&gt; type that now has ownership of the original value. Like Iter&lt;'a, T&gt;, it is this IntoIter&lt;T&gt; type that actually implements the Iterator trait. The word into is commonly used in Rust to signal that T is being moved. The docs also use the words owned or consumed interchangeably with moved. I normally find myself using .into_iter() when I have a function that is transforming some values:\n\nThe get_names function is plucking out the name from a list of tuples. I chose .into_iter() here because we are transforming the tuple into a String type.\nThe concept behind .into_iter() is similar to the core::convert::Into trait we discussed when accepting &amp;str and String in a function. In fact, the std::iter::Iterator type implements std::iter::IntoIterator too. That means we can do something like vec![1, 2, 3, 4].into_iter().into_iter().into_iter(). In each subsequent call to .into_iter() just returns itself. This is an example of the identity function. I mention that only because I find it interesting to identify functional concepts that I see being used in the wild.\nHow for Loops Actually Work\nOne of the first errors a new Rustacean will run into is the move error after using a for loop:\n\nThe question we immediately ask ourselves is \"How do I create a for loop that uses a reference?\". A for loop in Rust is really just syntatic sugar around .into_iter(). From the manual:\n\nNow that we know .into_iter() creates a type IntoIter&lt;T&gt; that moves T, this behavior makes perfect sense. If we want to use values after the for loop, we just need to use a reference instead:\n\nInstead of moving values, which is type Vec&lt;i32&gt;, we are moving &amp;values, which is type &amp;Vec&lt;i32&gt;. The for loop only borrows &amp;values for the duration of the loop and we are able to move values as soon as the for loop is done.\ncore::iter::Cloned\nThere are times when you want create a new value when iterating over your original value. You might first try something like:\n\nExercise for the reader: Why would .iter() not work in this example?\nWhile this is valid, we want to give Rust every chance to optimize our code. What if we only wanted the first two names from that list?\n\nIf we clone all of x, then we are cloning all four elements, but we only need two of them. We can do better by using .map() to clone the elements of the underlying iterator:\n\nThe Rust compiler can now optimize this code and only clone two out of the four elements of x. This pattern is used so often that Rust core now has a special function that does this for us called cloned(). This is a recent addition and will be stable in Rust 1.1. Our code now looks something like:\n\nIterators Outside of Core\nThere is a really great crate, called itertools, that provides extra iterator adaptors, iterator methods and macros. If you are looking for some iterator functionality in the Rust docs and do not see it, there is a good chance it is part of itertools. I recently added an itertools::IterTools::sort_by() function so we can sort collections without needed to use a mutable iterator. One of the nice things about working with Rust is that the documentation looks the same across all these crates. The documentation for itertools looks the same as the documentation for Rust std library.\nRelated\n\nCreating a Rust function that accepts String or &amp;str\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/06/22/effectively-using-iterators-in-rust.html/","title":"Effectively Using Iterators In Rust"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/07/12/my-basic-understanding-of-mio-and-async-io.html/":{"body":"I needed async IO for a Rust project I was working on. My server needs to read some bytes from a client and then send those bytes back to all registered clients. I decided to use mio, the Rust async IO library, to build a server. All the examples I found showcased reading from a socket and then writing back to that same socket. Also, many of the examples had caveats about unhandled edge cases and used a lot of unwrap. Over the next three posts, I am going to walk through everything I learned about async (or evented) IO as it relates to mio, how I setup my server and talk in depth about some of the ways I thought about handling errors. Let us start with the an overview of how async IO works within the context of mio.\nHow mio Exposes Async IO\nI initially thought the mio library was a Rust wrapper around libev. To my surprise, I realized mio is a replacement for libev. The name mio (metal IO) starts to make a lot more sense. The mio library is interfacing directly with epoll if you are on linux and kqueue if you are on FreeBSD (or OS X). The mio event loop interface expects us to know how the epoll/kqueue implementations work. Mio gives us complete control over how the async IO works, but it also means there is quite a bit to learn. After a decent amount of a reading, I believe I have a basic understanding of what some of the affordances mio exposes actually do.\nRegistration\nThe EventLoop object provided by mio is our main point of contact. Interaction with the event loop is in the form of the register, register_opt, reregister and deregister functions. These functions allow our code to control how the event loop interacts with the incoming client connections. All the functions, with the exception of deregister, require four arguments: a TcpStream socket for our client connection, a Token to identify connections, an EventSet to control what events we are notified of and a PollOpt to determine how we should be notified. The deregister function only needs the socket.\nUnderstanding how these functions work are key to understanding how to use mio. The concept of registering with an event loop is fairly straight forward, especially once you start looking at the code. It is the arguments to these registration functions that are more dense. I am going to assume you understand the basics of how a socket works and how to read and write bytes using that socket. The other arguments require some more in-depth discussion.\nTokens\nI found the use of tokens strange at first. I am more familiar with the use of callbacks to deal with asynchronous events. Mio uses tokens as an alternative to callbacks in order to achieve the design goal of zero allocations at runtime. The Token type is really just a tuple struct wrapper around usize. This means it is cheap to compare and copy. This will be important later when we start using the Token type.\nA Token is used to identify the state related to a connected socket. We register with the event loop using a token. Later on, the event loop will specify this token when notifying us of an event. A feedback loop of sorts is created. The Token is stored, along with the connection state, in the connection slab. I am going to discuss the connection slab when we start looking at the code. Trying to explain it without code feels overly complicated.\nEventSet (Formerly Known As Interest)\nThe EventSet object represents the set of events we are interested in being notified of. Until recently, the EventSet type was name Interest. The 0.3.x branch still refers to it as Interest. There are four types of events:\n\nreadable - Tells the event loop we want to read data from a client connection.\nwritable - Tells the event loop we want to write data to a client connection.\nhup - Tells the event loop that we want to be notified when a client closes the connection (hangs up).\nerror - Tells the event loop that we want to listen for errors.\n\nIf you are curious as to why Interest was renamed to EventSet, you can read the full discussion that ultimately resulted in the change. Essentially, epoll and kqueue have slightly different interfaces and this change made it easier for people using the mio library to handle those differences. The EventSet type removed the notion of a read hint that is present in many mio examples currently out there.\nWrite Notifications\nOne thing that confused me a lot was when to use writable. A lot of the examples are just echoing back what the client sent them or they are performing some very simple task. In these cases, you do not need to register EventSet::writable() if you want to immediately write back to the socket you just read from. You can just perform the write as part of the current readable event. If you are performing an expensive task between the read and write, you may want to handle this differently. Whether you are reading or writing from the socket, you also need to be aware that the kernel might not be ready for your read or write.\nI Would Block You\n[edit: I updated this section to replace the word block with more correct language like reject and not ready.]\nEven though we are using asynchronous IO, the kernel is not always ready for our reads and writes. When the kernel's internal send or receive buffers are full and it needs to flush them we will be asked to try again. Typically, the kernel communicates try again to us in the form of an error. In Rust, we have std::io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock. In C, it is referred to as EAGAIN. This error is the kernel's way of letting us know it is not ready for our read or write and they we need to try again. This WouldBlock error must be handled. In mio, we are provided with the traits, TryRead and TryWrite, which catch WouldBlock and treat it as a 0 byte read. These traits are convenient to use as our error handling can now assume any Err(_) is an unexpected error. More about this when we get to some code samples.\nYou might be wondering what it means to try again when the kernel is not ready for our read or write. In order to understand this, we need to understand the polling options.\nPoll Options\nThe PollOpts exposed by mio really tripped me up at first because I did not understand how epoll/kqueue worked at all. There are basically two different polling options, or triggers, we can use. By default, mio will specify PollOpt::level() when registering with the event loop. Level-triggered polling is what you would expect from a straight-forward polling implementation. If you are familiar with select() in C, this is basically the same thing. The downside to level-triggered polling is that we are expected to handle the events immediately. If we do not handle them immediately, then the event loop will notify us constantly of the event and we end up wasting resources.\nWhat most people opt for is edge-triggered, PollOpt::edge(), polling. Edge-triggred polling means that when we receive a read or write event, the event loop will automatically deregister our connection. This means we can get notified of an event and then have the option of handling it now or later. If more events come in for that connection, the event loop will queue those up for us until we register again. This requires us to have to manage the state of our connections, but gives us the flexibility we really want.\nWe can also combine edge-triggered polling with another option: PollOpt::oneshot(). Not only does this option sound super cool, it also guarantees that only one thread will be woken up. This allows us to be thread-safe when reading or writing. Thread safely unlocks the ability for allows us to write multi-threaded epoll processes on top of mio. For my server, I decided to register connections using PollOpt::edge() | PollOpt::oneshot() when registering with the event loop.\nTrying Again\nNow that we are familiar with what events we can be notified of and what our polling options are, we need to revisit the notion of trying our read or write again when the kernel not ready for us. Using edge-triggering, a read or write event means our connection will be deregistered from the event loop. To try again, we need to first save our work and then reregister our connection with the event loop, using our token, so we can be notified after the kernel is done flushing.\nNext Steps\nWe now have the necessary context to start using mio. It took days for these concepts to really sink in with me. If you grok this already, you are awesome. If not, give it time! I am going to apply these above concepts to actual code in my next post. If you want to get started before my next post, I would start with test echo server that is part of the mio test suite. There is also the getting started documentation that mio provides, though it is somewhat out of date for the 0.4.x branch.\nThere are also a few projects that are abstracting a lot of the details needed to get mio working. These can be great example to learn from. The two I have looked at are:\n\nReactor - Evented polling + network utilities to make life easier\nmioco - Allows handling mio connections inside coroutines\n\nSources\nIn addition to reading the mio soure code and example code, I did a lot of reading about epoll itself. Here is a list of some sources I used to get more familiar with epoll/kqueue:\n\nOverview of epoll options - StackOverflow post on the differences between level-triggered and edge-triggered polling\nPurpose of edge-triggered polling - StackOverflow post describing the real advantage of edge-triggered polling\nComplete epoll example in C - A blog post walking through an epoll implementation in C.

The scoping rules work out really well when using these functions. I was working with the slab crate recently and used the Slab#insert_with function. This function takes a callback where an object is supposed to be allocated before being inserted into the slab. The function returns an Option type. I was trying to figure out to drop the newly created object if the function returned None (meaning the insertion failed). After a few minutes it dawned on me that the object was out already dropped!\nExample:\n\nThe newly allocated MyType is moved from the callback into the Slab#insert_with scope. If the insert fails, then Slab#insert_with returns None. The newly allocated type is left within the Slab::insert_with function scope. Once Slab#insert_with returns, the newly allocated type will be automatically dropped. When an object is dropped, the destructor is called and any allocated memory will be freed.\n[edit: An explanation of drop semantics can be found here.]\nThe slab crate is an elegant little library that allocates a chunk of memory on the heap and stores values using a custom type for the index.

You may want to read first blog post if you are not familar with mio or epoll/kqueue implementations.\nBasic Setup\nAt the time of this writing, I am using the newly released mio 0.4.x. Until recently if you got mio from crates.io, then you will get 0.3.x. There are breaking changes between these two releases.\nI have a complete working example that has a lot of comments in the source code. I am going to skip over a lot of detail and try to focus on handling a read event and then writing it to all connected clients. If I am making too large of a leap, open up the source to get some more context.\nOur example will contain two main parts:\n\nA Server that handles events from our event loop and manages all connecitons.\nA Connection that represents new client connections.\n\nThe code does not use unwrap. I want to properly handle errors to get a feel for something written in mio that is closer to production ready. An error related to a Connection should reset that connection and never tear down the entire server. An error from the server, except during init, should cause a safe shutdown.\nServer\nHere is a quick overview of the Server struct.\n\nOur Server object will receive all the events from the event loop by implementing mio::Handler. A read event for the server token means a new client connection is coming in. We need to accept that new request, create a new Connection and add that connection object to our slab. A read event for any other token means we should already have established that connection. We need to forward the read event to that established connection.\n\nOur accept function will add a new connection to the connection slab. Slab is described as a Slab allocator for Rust. I just recently discovered where the term slab allocator came from. From what I have read about Slab, it allows us to use custom types as the index for an vector-like data structure. Within mio, the Slab type has been reexported as pub type Slab&lt;T&gt; = ::slab::Slab&lt;T, ::Token&gt;;. This means that the Token type will be the index and our Connection will be the value. Do not get confused, like I was, between the Slab type in the slab crate and the Slab type mio is reexporting.\nAlso, I will be using the Server#find_connection_by_token method all over the place. It is really just a thin wrapper to look up a connection with a given token: self.conns[token].\nLet us see the slab allocator in action:\n\nEstablished connections are forwarded to Server#readable. Connections are identified by the token provided to us from the event loop. Once a read has finished, push the receive buffer into the all the existing connections so we can echo it back to all the connections (remember, this is a multi-echo server).\n\nConnection\nThe Connection object represents a client connection. This looks similar to Server, with a few differences. I need keep track of what events we are interested in. By default, the connection is always interested in a read event. Only when we push messages into the send_queue will the connection be interested in a write event.\n\nWe are using MutByteBuf to read data from the socket. MutByteBuf, part of the bytes crate, is a heap allocated slice that mio supports internally. I prefer to use this as it does the work of tracking how much of our slice has been used. I chose a capacity of 2048 after reading some mio source code as that seems like a good size of streaming. If you are wondering what the difference between messaged based and continuous streaming read the answer to this StackOverflow question. TLDR: UDP vs TCP. We are using TCP.\n\nThe result of the read is pushed into all the existing connections write queue by Server#readble (we went over this function above). The last thing to do is to then write this message back to the client. The try_write_buf method is similar to the try_read_buf method we used above except that it expects a ByteBuf. I chose to only write one buffer from the queue to the client per write event. If there are still buffers in the queue, we remainig interested in writable events. If queue is empty, then we are no longer interested in write events.\n\nI am just getting into async io and mio, so my implementation may not be ideal, but it works. We have a functioning multi-echo server that is resistant to errors. The source also contains a simple client that will repeatedly write a message to the server and then read a message.\nOne thing that this code does not do well is handle reads from a client. In order to do that well, we need to establish a simple protocol. I am working through that now and will go over that in my next post.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/07/22/creating-a-multi-echo-server-using-rust-and-mio.html/","title":"Creating A Multi-echo Server using Rust and mio"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/08/03/creating-a-php-extension-to-rust.html/":{"body":"I am going to walk through the creation of a PHP extension that works with a Rust library. I have a working example here. I also created a PHP extension for my Rust selecta port. Both examples use the same foreign function interface (ffi). I made sure to pick an example that uses strings because strings add additional complexity that numbers do not introduce.\nBefore Getting Started\nnote: I created a docker container that will set environment up.\nYou are going to need a development version of PHP. You can test if you have it by running:\n\nIf the which command finds something like /usr/local/bin/phpize, you are in business. If you do not have it, I believe you can run yum install php-devel on CentOS or apt-get install php5-dev on Debian/Ubuntu. You can also compile PHP from source to get it.\nCompiling The Extension\nOur Rust library exposes a single function named ext_score. It takes two parameters of *const char and returns a 64-bit floating point type (or a double). To build the Rust library:\n\nOur PHP extension defines a single function named score that will glue PHP userland to our ext_score Rust function. To build the PHP extension:\n\nNow that we have a working example, we can explore what each of the files are actually doing.\nConfiguring The Extension\nI am going to dive right into the autotools stuff. I think autoconf is magic and the PHP wrappers around autoconf is dark magic. However, it is the biggest hurdle to getting a PHP extension working. All the stuff going on here is dense and it would take a whole blog post to go through it enough detail. You can usually get away with copy/pasting this stuff and tinkering with it so it works. I will try and touch on a number of things that have tripped me up though. If you make it through this section, the rest is easy.\nIf this is way more than you need, feel free to just start hardcoding stuff in your extension. I did! You can then skip down to where I start talking about the source code.\nHere is the config.m4 file I wrote for my extension. Let us walk through what is going on inside here.\n\nThe config.m4 file is a mix of bash, some autoconf (AC) functions and some custom PHP functions. At a high level, we are writing some code to detect where our Rust library exists and then add that information into a Makefile that we will auto-generated. That Makefile is generated from a script called configure. The majority of the configure script is going to be created for us by PHP tooling. However, we need to add some extension specific information.\nLet us start by hooking our extension into the configure script using PHP_ARG_WITH. The PHP_ARG_WITH function takes three parameters:\n\nThe name of the extension. This will be used to determine the name of our extension variable. In this case, $PHP_SCORE.\nThe human readable string shown when ./configure --with-score is run. Example: checking whether to enable the \"score\" extension... yes, shared\nThe human readable string shown when ./configure --help is run. This is why the spacing of the string is a bit odd.\n\nNow we can run ./configure --with-score and the configure script will know what we are talking about. Next, we need to tell the configure script where to find our library so it can add those details to the Makefile.\nNo Header File\nPHP assumes that a library comes with a header file that describes the functions a library exposes. Rust's FFI does not provide a header file. If we were working with a library, such as gearman, then we would expect /usr/include/gearman.h to exist. The standard PHP config.m4 file uses this header file to check if a library is installed or not. To work around this lack of a header file, we can look for the shared object file instead: SEARCH_FOR=\"/lib/libscore.so\". Now that we have a Rust compatible file to check for, we need to start searching for it.\nBefore we start checking for our libscore.so shared object in commonly used directories like /usr and /usr/local, we want to first allow an override via ./configure --with-score=/path/to/library. This is really useful when working on our Rust library in conjunction with the PHP extension. I can run cargo build and that will install libscore.so in /home/herman/projects/selecta/php-ext/target/debug/. I can then configure my PHP extension using ./configure --with-score=/home/herman/projects/selecta/php-ext/target/debug/. When I specify a path like this, the path will be stored in the $PHP_SCORE variable. This saves us from having to repeatedly install our Rust library. If no override was specified, we can start searching some common places. Feel free to add more directories to search for, such as /opt/local.\nValidating Before Linking\nWe have located a file called libscore.so, but we need to make sure it is a valid library file. The PHP_CHECK_LIBRARY function is used to validate our shared object contains a known function, or symbol. The PHP_CHECK_LIBRARY function takes five parameters:\n\nThe name of the library. In our case score will be transformed into -lscore when compiling. Example: cc -o conftest -g  -O0  -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lscore conftest.c\nThe name of the function to try and find within our score library.\nThe set of actions to take if the function is found. In our case, we are adding to the Makefile code to compile against our library and defining HAVE_SCORE which is used by the during compilation.\nThe set of actions to take if the function is not found. In our case, we are throwing an error with a human readable error message.\nThe set of extra library definitions. In our case, we are making sure the compiler knows where to find our shared object.\n\nThe PHP_ADD_LIBRARY_WTH_PATH function takes three parameters:\n\nThe name of the library.\nThe path to the library.\nThe name of a variable to store library information. We will use this with PHP_SUBST.\n\nFinal Steps\nWe are almost there!\nThe PHP_SUBST function adds a variable with its value into the Makefile.\nThe PHP_NEW_EXTENSION function takes a lot of parameters, but I am only going to go over three:\n\nThe name of the extension\nThe list of sources, or files, used to build the extension.\nWhether the extension should be dynamically loaded or statically compiled. The $ext_shared variables sets this to the proper value.\n\nBuilding Your Own Extension\nNormally, you can use the ext_skel program to create an PHP extension out of the box. However, the ext_skel generated config.m4 file makes some assumptions that Rust violates. It is a good starting point though. Change to the directory where you want the extension to be created and then run ext_skel:\n\nThis will create a /home/herman/projects/php-rust-ext directory with the following files: config.m4  config.w32  tests. I did not go over config.w32 as that is for Windows and I am woefully ignorant when it comes to PHP and Windows. The config.m4 has a lot of the comments to help you and you have my notes above to make any necessary changes.\nMaking Changes To config.m4\nOnce you think you have the config.m4 file properly setup, run the phpize command. This program will add a bunch of auto-generated files to your directory. Feel free to .gitignore them and do not check them into version control. Most importantly, it creates our configure file which we will now use to generate our Makefile.\nYou will need to make changes to the config.m4 to get your specific extension working with your library. If you make a change to the config.m4 file, then make sure you run phpize again. If you make a change and then just run ./configure --with-score then you will not get the benfit of your changes.\nExtension Header File\nHere is the standard PHP header file for an extension. The convention is to use php_[extension-name].h as the name. In our case, php_score.h.\n\nYou can copy/paste most of this and replace SCORE and score with the name of your extension. I chose to define the score libraries functions here. We are telling the compiler that something external to our code is defining a function named ext_score. This allows our code to compile successfully when we go to use this Rust function. Make sure you list all the functions your Rust library is exposing.\nExtension Source Code\nThe score.c file is a little long and most of it is uninteresting. The full score.c file is here. Let us explore the relevant portion where we create a PHP userland function named score to call our Rust ext_score function.\n\nWe declare new PHP functions using the PHP_FUNCTION macro and pass it the name of the function. If you are using gdb and you want to break on this function, the macro transforms it into zif_[func-name]. In our case: zif_score. The zif stands for Zend Interface Fucntion. You will notice the word Zend being used a lot as that is the name of the PHP virutal machine (and the name of the company whose founders built the vm).\nWe are using the zend_parse_parameters function to parse the paramters being specified in our userland function. In this case, we are expecting two strings. If this function looks a little gnarly, well that is because it is. I will provide some links at the end that explain how this function works in more detail. Suffice to say, we get back two non-nul terminated char * values and their corresponding lengths as ints.\nWe can pass the strings into our ext_score function, get a result back and then return that value to userland PHP. We now have a working end-to-end PHP extension to a Rust library.\nFurther Reading\nFor some detail on the PHP (or Zend) specific functions and macros:\n\nExtension Writing Part I: Introduction to PHP and Zend\nExtension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs\n\nIf you are really serious about building PHP extensions, I suggest purchasing Sara Goleman's excellent book on Extending and Embedding PHP.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/08/03/creating-a-php-extension-to-rust.html/","title":"Creating a PHP Extension to Rust"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/08/23/using-docker-to-test-rust-on-linux.html/":{"body":"I use a MacBook Air as my main laptop.

I do not need an entire virutalized operating system, just a place to test my programs. This seems like a good use case for Docker.\nThe first thing I had to do was get boot2docker installed. This was pretty straight-forward, but did take a fair bit of time. The second thing was finding an upstream Rust container (I think this is called an image) to use. I do not want to build one myself. Doing a search on Docker Hub I chose the schickling/rust container. The repo info had a simple walkthrough, the Dockerfile itself seemed straightforward and it included gdb.\nThis container is setup to be used interatively or to run commands. To run cargo tests:\n\nLet us go over the command. If you are familiar with Docker, you can skip this section. To start, docker run runs a command in a new contianer. The --rm, -it and -v flags are very common when running Docker containers. Here is what they mean:\n\n--rm - automatically remove the container when it exists. This means when the command is over, the container will stop running. This removes the container, but not the schickling/rust image.\n-it - make the docker container interactive and allocate a tty. This basically means your shell will work.\n-v - mount a volume. In the example above, it binds the local present working directory to the /source directory inside the container.\n\nAfter the flags, we specify the upstream Docker container name schickling/rust and then finally our command.\nIf you want to run experiment inside the linux container, just omit a command. The docker file used to buildschickling/rust specifies bash as the default command.\n\nThis is basically like a vagrant ssh command. You will be given a shell inside the container. I do this when playing with mob because I want to run the server, then the client in various ways. Example:\n\nMake sure you run cargo build inside the container as Linux cannot run the executable built on OS X. If you see the error bash: ./target/debug/mob-server: cannot execute binary file then you need to cargo build. I then run the mob server in the background and send the log output to a file. I run the mob client (sometimes repeatedly). When done, I use the fg command to bring the mob server process back into the foreground where I can terminate it (using Ctrl-C). I then exit the container (using Ctrl-D), the container is cleaned up and I can start fresh again if I want.\nDocker was fairly easy to get setup and I have found it to be more efficient for these types of use-cases.

There are two common network protocols in use today: UDP and TCP. UDP is a message oriented protocol that delivers the message in one chunk. The downside to UDP is that there is no guarantee of message delivery because UDP does not handle packet loss. Many people want to protect against packet loss so they choose TCP instead. TCP is a stream oriented protocol. Data is sent byte by byte. A \"message\" may come one byte at a time, in multi-byte chunks or all at once. The only thing we can count on with TCP is that the bytes will arrive in the same order they were sent. And here is the reason we need a higher level protocol: It is task of the receiving socket to determine when it has enough data to make any sense of it.\nI have seen two basic approaches to building a higher level protocol. The HTTP standard uses both, so let us look at how it works. An HTTP request is split into two parts: a header section and a body section. The header section contains meta information, mostly in the form of headers, used to precisely describe the request. We do not know ahead of time how long a header is or how many headers a request sends. However, HTTP uses \\r\\n to signal the end of the header. Within the header section is the Content-Length header that specifies how many bytes the body section is. So one approach is to use a marker, such as \\r\\n, to signal the end of the message. Another approach is to explicitly specify how many bytes to read. HTTP also has a chunked transfer encoding option in in HTTP 1.1 that combines both of these approaches to read the body section.\nThere are some really powerful tools for building protocols, such as capnproto. I wanted something very simple that I could implement. I decided to tell the receiver how many bytes of data they should be expecting. To do this, I use the first 64 bits to specify how many bytes I am sending over the wire. My custom protocol is not discoverable. Both the sender and receiver have to agree ahead of time on this protocol and implement it.\nThe basic strategy for receiving is as follows:\n\nRead the first 64 bits from the socket.\nConvert those bits into a u64 type and determine the length of the message.\nRead message_length bytes from the socket.\n\nEither of the reads can receieve WouldBlock which, we know, means we have to try again later. This is not a problem for our first read of the 64 bytes. However, if we receive WouldBlock during the second read then we have to remember to not try and read the first 64 bytes from the socket when we try again. This means we have to keep some state around reads. We need to keep track of two peices of information. The first is whether or not we are in the middle of reading. The second is if we are in the middle of reading then we need to keep track of how many bytes the message is. I added read_continuation: Option&lt;u64&gt; to my Connection struct to capture this.\nHere is how we read the message length:\n\nThe function starts out by checking if we are in the middle of a read. If we are in the middle of a read, we already know the message length and can just return it immediately. Otherwise, I try to read 8 bytes from the socket. The try_read function is provided by mio and will return Ok(None) on WouldBlock. If the read fails or less than 8 bytes were received, we return an error that will cause this connection to be reset. Finally, I use the byteorder crate to convert the bytes into a u64 that will tell us how long the message is.\n\nOur readable function starts out by determining the length of the message and then creates a vector with a capacity that is at least message length. I would have preferred a fixed slice, but I do not know of a way to create that slice dynamically. Then we need to read at most msg_len bytes from the socket. We can do this using the take function. This starts to look a bit messy due to some Rust issues. If we just call self.sock.by_ref() Rust is not able to determine which by_ref function to use. The error message looks something like:\n\nIn order to resolve this, we need to use Universal Function Call Syntax, also called UFCS. Using UFCS, we can be explicit about which by_ref function we want. We can then use that reference to take at most msg_len bytes from the socket. Now we just need to handle the the different responses from the socket. If try_read returns None (meaning WouldBlock), then we need to store the length of the message in self.read_continuation so we can try again later. If we successfully read from the socket, we set self.read_continuation to None so the next readable event will know to first determine the message length.\nI have tested this a fair bit and find it works well. The fact that mob echos every received message to every connected socket causes messages to naturally coalecse. Knowing the message length ahead of time helps separate the messages out. The write strategy is similar to the read strategy that I will not go over it here. The working code is located on the on github, so please use that as a reference for the write strategy if you are curious. Having a basic protocol like this is exiciting as it will set us up to handle sending or receiving json, xml or other data format later on.\nRelated\n\nCreating A Multi-echo Server using Rust and mio\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/09/12/creating-a-simple-protocol-when-using-rust-and-mio.html/","title":"Creating A Simple Protocol When Using Rust and mio"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/09/21/get-data-from-a-url-rust.html/":{"body":"Tested on Rust 1.3\nHere is a high level of example of how to make a HTTP GET request to some URL. To make the example a little more interesting, the URL will have a json response body. We will parse the body and pluck some values from the parsed json.\nThere are a number of crates we could use to make an HTTP GET request, but I am partial to curl. The curl library should be familiar to a wide set of audiences and libcurl is rock solid. Also, I think the Rust interface to curl is really easy to read and use. I am going to request the HauteLook API root because that is where I work and it will return Hal json.\n\nA few things to point out. The curl crate allows the functions to be chained together so it reads really nice. We can map the methods directly to the curl C interface:\n\nhttp::handle() -&gt; curl_easy_init()\nget(url) -&gt; curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_URL, url);\nexec() -&gt; curl_easy_perform(handle);\n\nThe C interface would normally require us to explicitly close the handle, but Rust does this automatically for us. In Rust, we also need to unwrap the Result&lt;Response, ErrCode&gt; returned by the call to exec(). Rather than just use unwrap(), we can use unwrap_or_else() and generate a more user-friendly error message. I will be using unwrap_or_else() throughout this example.\nNow that we have a response, we need to parse the json. Again, there are a number of crates we can use for this task. Let us choose serde_json as that looks to be the successor to rustc_serialize. Before we start parsing json, we need to get at the response body. In curl, resp.get_body() will return a reference to a slice of unsigned 8 bit intgers &amp;[u8]. We need to turn those bytes into a unicode string slice.\n\nNow that we have our string slice, we can attempt to parse than string into a json Value type. This type will allow us to access specific fields within the json data.\n\nLet us take a look at the json response before we look at the code to pluck values from it. Without going into specifics about Hal or hypermedia, we have a json object that contains one key named _links. This key _links has a number of link relations that correspond to an object that contains an href.\n\nLet us write some code to print out each link relation with the corresponding href value. This will involve us first getting _links and then iterating over the link releations inside of _links.\n\nIn serde, the Value type represents all possible json values. Before we can do something meaningful, we must convert the value to a more specific json type. Since our json starts out as an object with one key, we need to first use the as_object() function. The as_object() function will convert the Value into a BTreeMap type. We can then use the get function that comes with BTreeMap to get at our link relations. I am using the and_then() funtion avoid dealing with unwrap() over and over. I could have also written the code to get links like this:\n\nSince links is just a BTreeMap, we can iterate over all the key value pairs using links.iter(). The link relation, rel,  is the key and the link is the value. I am using the find() function to get the href out of the link. The find() function basically combines as_object() and get(). In order to get the actual URL string, we need to use the as_string() function. All the functions to convert Value to a more specific type are here. There are also some more advanced functions like lookup() and search().\nHere is the code in its entirety:\n\nWe now have all the knowledge we need to work with URLs that return a json response.

The oft repeated question of Why doesn't mio have callbacks? is evidence of this. In fact, it is a design goal of mio to add only as much abstraction necessary to provide a consistent API for the various OS async IO implementations. A consequence of this design decision is that there are subtle behavioral differences between platforms. It may be tempting to let mio manage the state of various connections, but I have found that this can have unintended consequences. For example, until recently mio internally buffered kqueue events. The way epoll is designed does not warrant buffering events and those of us using kqueue encountered some interesting panic behavior on kqueue. I was able to avoid this issue when I started managing connection state in conjunction with the recently added Handler::tick() function.\nThe idea for adding Handler::tick() came from a discussion abbout deregister bevhavior. The idea is that at the end of each event loop tick, the Handler::tick() function will be called. By default this function does nothing. We can implement this function to act as a checkpoint to sync the state of our connections with mio before the start of the next event loop tick. We have three types of state:\n\nsocket state - whether the connection is reset or not.\nevent state - whether we need to register, reregister or do nothing.\nread/write state - whether we are in the middle of a read/write or not. I discussed a solution to this in my post on Creating A Simple Protocol When Using Rust and mio.\n\nSocket State\nOur connection socket can stop working for many different reasons. When this does happen, we need to remove the connection from the connection slab. One straight-forward approach is to immediately remove the connection from the slab when there is an error related to the socket. Keep in mind though that just because we had an error when trying to handle an event does not mean that there is not another event for that same token. If we try to handle that later event by looking up that connection using a token, we will inadvertently panic. We are now forced to try and keep track of whether a token still exists in the slab inside our Handler.\nInstead of removing the connection from the slab immediately, we can keep track of whether the connection is reset or not inside the Connection struct. If we encounter an error, we will mark the socket as reset and leave the connection in the connection slab until the event loop tick is finished. Now that we have this information local to the connection, our Handler can check whether or not the connection is reset before trying to dispatch events to it. Finally, when our Handler::tick() method is called, we can check each connection to see if it is reset. If the connection is reset, we can then remove the connection from the slab. Since we did this at the end of the event loop, we can now be confident there are no more spurious events for our token.\nLet us implement a simple way to keep track of socket state. The first thing we need to do is add an is_reset: bool variable to our Connection struct. If is_reset is true, then we will remove the connection from our connection slab. We will also create two new functions on our Connection:\n\nNow the server can quickly determine if a connection has already been reset. If a connection is reset, we want to drop any readable or writeable events. If the connection is not reset, we are confident that we can dispatch an event to that connection. If there is an error when dispatching the event to the connection, then we want to mark that connection as reset.\n\nAt the end of the event loop tick, we can loop through our connections and check if any are reset. If they are, we then remove them from the connection slab. Unfortunately, there is not a real good way to iterate over the slab and remove connections from it. Future changes to the slab crate should make this easier by adding features like Vec::retain.\n\nNotice that we do not call the EventLoop::deregister() method when a connection is removed from the slab. When we remove a connection from the slab, mio will internally deregister the connection so no more events will be sent. If we call deregister too early, some async I/O implementations (such as kqueue) will send that event as Token(0).\nEvent State\nWhen I started using mio, I put calls to rereregister all over the place. I found a couple of problems with this approach. The first problem is that it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of when connections are getting added to or removed from the event loop. The second problem is that any spurious event has a good chance of causing a panic. Remember, this is asynchronous behavior and our mental model is often incorrect. I believe the best strategy is to handle all registration related activities inside of Handler::tick(). We can make it a goal not to reregister a connection more than once per event loop tick. We should also make it a goal not to reregister if the connection has not received an event.\nSimilar to our strategy with tracking socket state, we can add an is_idle: bool to our Connection struct. We will also add two similar functions:\n\nAt the bottom of our Handler::ready() method, we need to mark the connection as being idle:\n\nOur Handler::tick() method will now need to reregister any connection that is in an idle state. We can add combine the check for reregisration with the check for reset connections in the same loop. We end up with:\n\nThe full code can be found here: https://github.com/hjr3/mob/tree/state-blog-post.\nWe now have four variables tracking various parts of our Connection state: is_reset, is_idle, read_continuation and write_continuation. The latter two being discussed in a previous blog post. There is some overlap amongst these variables and I am thinking about how to represent all this state with one state variable on the Connection class.\nWe are also doing a loop over the connection slab for each event loop tick. This can get heavy if we have a lot of connections in the slab. Usually connections are not dropping off that often and we if we are not under load we may not have many connections eligible to be reregistered. Right now, I am willing to take the perf hit in order to not crash. However, I am thinking about ways to accomplish the safety without having to loop so often.\nWhile the soluations may not be ideal, I think it is worth talking about some of the challenges I faced getting mob working on top of mio. Some of the answers have been organic in nature and I will continue to improve them as I learn more.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2015/10/23/managing-connection-state-with-mio-rust.html/","title":"Managing Connection State With mio"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/01/18/exploring-rust-std-library.html/":{"body":"I was writing some Rust with a colleague when they asked me about the cases where Rust deferences types for us automatically. I said that Rust will automatically dereference pointers when making method calls, but otherwise there was no compiler magic. This conflicted with their experience with Rust and presented an example like this:\n\nThe basic question is: \"How does this code work without us dereferencing b?\". I think this is a great question and touches on an aspect of Rust that I really like.\nRust is written in, well, Rust. While I myself do not understand much of the type checking code, I can read and understand the vast majority of the core and standard libraries. Many languages, especially scripted ones, are not like this. Often times the core and standard libraries are written in C. In order to see how this code works you have to not only understand C, but also understand how the data structures in C relate to your language. The barrier to entry is quite high. The net result is that most people rely on documentation, blogs or stack overflow to understand how major parts of the language work. They cannot go see for themselves. I really like that major parts of Rust proper are much more accessible.\nLet us go see for ourselves why we can add a type T and a reference to a type &amp;U. Along the way we will learn how to explore some of the inner workings of Rust. To start, we need to bring up the std library documentation webpage. We can then search for the word \"add\" and the first result will be std::ops::Add with a summary descriptipn of The Add trait is used to specify the functionality of +. That seems like a good place to start. We now know that adding two things together is implemented using the Add trait. The webpage for the Add trait even shows us a simple implementation.\nScrolling down the webpage will list all the implementations of the Add trait that exist in the standard library. Looking at 14th item in that list, you will see impl&lt;'a&gt; Add&lt;&amp;'a usize&gt; for usize. The standard library has a specific implementation of the Add trait for the case when the right hand side (rhs) of the addition is a reference to a type. If you scroll down more you will see that all the numeric types are listed. Each numeric type has implementations of the Add trait for T + U, &amp;T + U, T + &amp;U and &amp;T + &amp;U. You can also find similar results for subtraction, multiplication and division.\nYou will find this pattern repeated over and over in Rust. Some generic functionality is represented as a trait. In order to specify that functionality, that trait must be implemented. It is not uncommon to see long lists of implementations for traits in the standard library. While this may appear to be a lot of boilerplate, the benefit is that Rust can check our code at compile time (the alternative would be to wait until runtime which is less safe and makes our code slower).\nIf we jump back to the list of implementations for the Add trait you might notice something interesting. The standard library does not specify implementations for addition between different types. This code will not work:\n\nIf you ever ran into a compiler error about adding two different numeric types together before and wondered why that does not work, now you know. It is not some compiler magic, but instead the simple fact that the standard library does not list impl Add&lt;u32&gt; for u64.\nI mentioned above that we should not have to rely on the documentation to understand how standard features work. So far, we have been relying on the excellent documentation of the Rust standard library. If we scroll back up the webpage, we should see the [src] link to the actual source code for the Add trait. If we follow that link, we will see the definition of the Add trait and then a macro called add_impl! being defined. Macros can be a little hard to understand, but if we can generally understand that this macro defines T + T. Right below that macro we should see something like:\n\nNow we see how all the numeric types implement the Add trait for T + T. We need to look a little deeper to understand how references are handled. If we look back at the bottom of the add_impl! macro we will see another macro called forward_ref_binop!. If we scroll up the page we can find the definition for forward_ref_binop! and we will notice that it defines the behavior for &amp;T + U, T + &amp;U and &amp;T + &amp;U. Take note that the use of macros greatly decreased the amount of boilerplate in the Rust standard library. Macros are harder to read, but they are certainly powerful.\nI find myself following the above approach when I run into something about Rust I do not understand. This even works for crates listed on crates.io that generate documentation. For example, the mio crate hosts documentation on Amazon S3 but the look, feel and functionality are the same as the official Rust documentation webpages. There are other ancillary benefits to exploring the Rust standard library. Along the way you learn things you were not explicitly looking for. The standard library can also be a great reference for how to implement something. The code is written to a high standard and puts a lot of emphasis on correctness. Reading the core and standard libraries may seem daunting at first, especially if you are not familar with macros, but stick with it. With some practice and patience it will become much more familiar to you. At that point, you can start contributing too!\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/01/18/exploring-rust-std-library.html/","title":"Exploring the Rust Standard Library"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/03/17/unions-rust-ffi.html/":{"body":"When building a foreign function interface to C code, we will inevitably run into a struct that has a union. Rust has no built-in support for unions, so we must come up with a strategy on our own. A union is a type in C that stores different data types in the same memory location. There are a number of reasons why someone may want to choose a union, including: converting between binary representations of integers and floats, implementing pseudo-polymorphism and direct access to bits. I am going to focus on the pseudo-polymorphism case.\nEdit: Added a warning at the bottom based on feedback from Joe Groff.\nNote: This post assumes the reader is familiar with Rust FFI, endianess and ioctl.\nAs an example, let us get the MAC address based on an interface name. We can summarize the steps to get the MAC address as follows:\n\nSpecify a request type to be used with ioctl. If I want to get the MAC (or hardware) address, I specify SIOCGIFHWADDR.\nWrite the interface name to ifr_name. An interface name is something like eth0.\nMake the request using ioctl. A successful request will write some data to ifr_ifru.\n\nFor more details on how to get a MAC address, read this howto.\nWe need to use the C ioctl function and also pass the ifreq struct to the function. Looking in /usr/include/net/if.h, we can see that ifreq is defined as follows:\n\nThe ifr_ifru union is where things start to get tricky. Glancing at the possible types in ifr_ifru, we notice that they are not all the same size. A short is 2 bytes and u_int32_t is 4 bytes. To complicate matters, we have a number of different struct definitions of unknown size. It is important that we figure out exactly what the size of the ifreq struct so we can write the proper Rust code. I wrote a small C program and figured out that ifreq uses 16 bytes for ifr_name and 24 bytes for ifr_ifru.\nArmed with the knowledge of how large teh struct is, we can start representing this in Rust. One strategy is to make a specialized struct for each type in the union.\n\nWe can use IfReqShort when making a request of type SIOCGIFINDEX. This struct is smaller than the ifreq struct in C though. Even though we are expecting only 2 bytes to be written, the external ioctl interface expects there to be a total of 24 bytes. To be safe, let us add 22 bytes of padding at the end:\n\nWe would then repeat this process for each type in the union. I find this a bit tedious to do as we need to make a lot of structs and be very careful to make them the correct size. Another way to represent the union is to have a buffer of raw bytes. We can make a single C representation of ifreq in Rust like this:\n\nThis union buffer can store the raw bytes for any type. We can now define methods to convert the raw bytes into the type we want. We will avoid unsafe code by not using transmute. Let us create a method to get the MAC address by converting the raw bytes in a sockaddr C type.\n\nWith this strategy, we have one struct and a method to convert the raw bytes into the concrete type that we want. Looking back at our ifr_ifru union, we will notice that there are at least two others requests that will also require me to create a sockaddr from raw bytes. To DRY this up, we could implement a private method on IfReq to convert raw bytes to sockaddr. However, we can do better by abstracting away the details of creating a sockaddr, short, int, etc from IfReq. We really just want to tell the union to give me back a specified type. So, let us make a IfReqUnion type to do that:\n\nWe implement methods for each of the various types that make up the union. Now that our type conversions are handled by IfReqUnion, we can now implement the methods on IfReq like this:\n\nWe ended up with two structs. We have IfReq that represents the memory layout of the C struct ifreq. We will implement a method on IfReq for each type of ioctl request. We also have the IfRequnion struct that handles the various types the ifr_ifru union might be. We will create a method to for each type we need to handle. This is less work than creating a specialized struct for each type in the union and provides a better interface than doing the type conversion in IfReq.\nHere is a more complete working example. This is still a bit of a work in progress, but the tests pass and the code incorporates the above concepts discussed.\nWarning\nThe above approach is not without problems. In the case of ifreq, we were fortunate that ifr_name was 16 bytes and was aligned on a word boundary. If ifr_name was not aligned to a 4 byte word boundary, then we will run into a problem. Our union type is [u8; 24] which has an alignment of a single byte. This is not the same alignment as a type of size 24 bytes. Here is a short example to illustrate this point. If we have a C struct with the following union:\n\nThe above foo struct has a size of 8 bytes. Two bytes for x, two more bytes for padding and four bytes for y. If we tried to write this in Rust:\n\nThe above Foo struct is only 6 bytes. Two bytes for x and then we can fit the first two u8 elements of y in the same 4 byte word as x. This subtle difference may cause problems when being passed to a C function that is expecting a struct of 8 bytes.\nUntil Rust natively supports unions, this sort of FFI is difficult to get right. Good luck, but be careful!\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/03/17/unions-rust-ffi.html/","title":"Working with C unions in Rust FFI"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/05/16/creating-a-basic-webservice-in-rust.html/":{"body":"In this post I am going to walk through the creation of a webservice in Rust. This is a Getting Started post that will serve as a foundation for future posts. The webservice will return a static json response to start. There are a few different options for web frameworks in Rust, but practically all of them use the underlying HTTP library called hyper. I am most familiar with nickel, so we will be using that. Once the code is complete, we will be creating a release build that is a completely static (standalone) binary. We will then be able to deploy this binary on any modern Linux distro, including Ubuntu and Alpine Linux.\nBefore we get into any real code, I want to document the environment I am using so you can follow along. I am using a MacBook Air with OS X version 10.11.4. I installed Rust using rustup.rs and am using the current stable Rust version 1.8.0. At the time of this writing, rustup is in beta. However, it is quite stable and will soon be the official way to install Rust. I will not go into detail on how to install rustup. Please see the official documentation for that. Finally, I will be using a docker container to build a static binary using musl. I will be doing all development on my laptop and only using the docker container and musl to create a release build.\nMac OS X information:\n\nRust version (and toolchain):\n\nDocker version:\n\nI mentioned earlier that we are going to using a web framework that is based on the hyper crate. The hyper crate supports TLS/SSL using the OpenSSL library. Unfortunately, Mac OS X 10.11 switched to using LibreSSL instead. In order to compile our webservice, we need to first install OpenSSL. While annoying, this is trivially easy using homebrew.\n\nNote: If you really do not want to install OpenSSL, you can build debug versions on the docker container too. Build times will be slow and testing/debugging will be significantly more difficult.\nNow we can finally get to coding. Let us start by creating a new project using Cargo.\n\nNow we need to add the nickel web framework so we can accept HTTP requests and deliver responses. We can be a little less conservative than crates.io when specifying my dependencies. None of these crates are 1.0 yet, but they are being developed and maintained. We do not want to wildcard (\"*\") the entire version number for each dependency as that will leave our webservice suscepitble to backwards compatibility breaks in the future. Leaving the patch version a wildcard will allow us to update the libraries when they have bug fixes in the future without risking a major backwards compatibility break. Edit: As was explained to me, cargo will update to the latest compatible version (in accordance with SemVer) by default. So 0.8.1, 0.8.* and ^0.8.1 all mean the same thing. The standard convention is to specify the version shown to you on crates.io. I have updated the below Cargo.toml example.\n\nWhen we cargo build, we will download and compile 45 total crates into our webservice. This will also create a Cargo.lock file that contains exact information about our dependencies. Since we are building a binary/executable, we will commit the lock file with the rest of our code.\nNow we can open up src/main.rs and start creating our service. In this first step, I will show how to write a handler for an HTTP GET request that generates a very simple json response.\n\nLet us walk through the above code. We start by importing the nickel crate. The nickel crate includes macros and in order to use them we need to put #[macro_use] in front of the import statement. We then need to specify which parts of the nickel crate we want to use. It is valid to put use nickel::*, but I prefer to be explicit about which parts of a crate I am using.\nOur main function is the entry point of our program. We create a new server object, declare what routes we want to handle and then start listening for requests. The design of nickel is similar to the Express node.js framework. The server.utilize function is used to register middleware with the server object. Using the router! macro, we can specify each route we want to handle. To start, we want to accept an HTTP GET request for /foo. We can now specify how we want to handle that request inside of a lambda function.\nThe lambda function includes request and response parameters. Since we are not looking at any information from the request, we prepend it with an underbar (_) so the compiler does not throw a warning. We will be modifying the response to set the media type, so we prepend that with mut. We then set the media type for the response as json and create a literal json string to return. The r#...# syntax is the raw literal string notation in Rust.\nWe now have a working webservice. Let us see it in action.\nStart the server:\n\nMake a request in another terminal:\n\nThe last thing we will do is create a static binary that can run on a modern Linux server. This is known as cross-compiling and it is becoming a first-class feature of the Rust ecosystem. By default, compiling a Rust program to run on Linux has a few dynamic dependencies. There are many pros and cons to the static vs dynamic debate, but in this example I want to make the webservice completely static so I can deploy it without relying on the presence of any dynamic libraries. Mac OS X uses clang instead of gcc. In order to use musl, we will need gcc. I am going to use a docker container rather than install gcc. At the time of this writing, I am using Docker for Mac (beta). It should not matter how you have docker running on OS X though. I am going to use the rust-musl-builder docker container, which was built specifically for this purpose.\nIf you do not have the container installed, running the below command will first pull that container. Annoyingly, it will not execute the command after it downloads the container.\n\nNow that we have the container, we can create the release build. It is going to take a bit of time. Rust has to download all the dependencies on that container, compile each of them and then compile our main program. We also specified the --release flag so Rust is optimizing each step of the build process.\nWe now have a 2.5MB statically compiled executable. We can run our webservice on any modern Linux distro just by copying the file there and running it. There is still a lot more to do to make a production ready webservice, but this is the basic foundation that we will refer back to when making future improvements. You can find the complete working example on github at https://github.com/hjr3/webservice-demo-rs.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/05/16/creating-a-basic-webservice-in-rust.html/","title":"Creating a basic webservice in Rust"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/05/23/connecting-webservice-database-rust.html/":{"body":"Note: This blog post does not work with rustc 1.19.0 or later due to a regression in rust 1.19.0. Use the following to set rust 1.18.0 up:\n\nIn this post we are going to hook our basic webservice up to a database. The webservice will accept a request for /orders, query the database for orders and return a json response. I will be using PostgreSQL in this example. There is a pure Rust PostresSQL driver written by Steven Fackler (sfackler) that I think is well done. That being said, the mysql crate looks well done too.\nThis post goes into a fair amount of detail. You can skip right to the TL;DR for the final solution.\nPreparation\nWe have to get Postgres setup before we start writing Rust code. I am using https://github.com/jackdb/pg-app-dev-vm in combination with Vagrant to automatically provision a working Postgres instance. Simply clone the git repository and then vagrant up. I am using the default values of myapp for username, dbpass for the password and myapp for the database name. I also have a script called db-migrate.sh that will create the orders schema necessary to get this example working.\nCrate Dependencies\nAt this point we have a working database instance with an orders tables containing two rows. The first thing we need to do is update our Cargo.toml file with our postgres dependency. We also need to add the rustc-serialize crate so we can serialize a native Rust data structure into json format. Next time we run cargo build both crates will automatically be downloaded and made available to our webservice.\n\nNote: The rustc-serialize crate works, but it is not being actively developed. The future of json serialization is the serde_json crate. Unfortunately, serde's ability to automatically serialize data structures is only available on Rust nightly (the version of Rust in active development). Due to this restriction, I have chosen to use rustc-serialize instead.\nWe now need to open up src/main.rs and start adding our dependencies. We need to import the postgres and rustc_serialize crates. These two crates are not exporting macros, so we can leave off the #[macro_use] attribute. Also, notice that the crate name rustc-serialize (hyphen) is imported as rustc_serialize (underbar). The rustc-serialize crate is from early Rust days and the rules around crate names has changed.\nNow we will alias which parts of the crates we want to use. We will be using the postgres Connection struct and the SslMode enum. We also will be using the rustc_serialize json module.\n\nOrder Struct\nWe will be querying the database for orders and then mapping the resulting rows into one more objects. Our database schema contains an orders table with an order id, an order total, the type of currency that was used and the status of the order. We need to create an Order struct to map each row to. The postgres crate provides type correspondence documentation that maps each Postgres type to a Rust type. Using that information, we can create the Order struct with the correct types.\nOnce the query result has been mapped into an Order struct, we want to serialize that into json. We could manually implement the ToJson trait that tells rustc_serialize how to convert an Order struct into json, but I do not want to write code unless I have to. Instead, we can use the #[derive()] attribute and automatically generate the trait implementation for RustcEncodable. The RustcEncodable trait will allow us to call json::encode() on our Order struct.\n\nUsing #[derive()] can feel a bit like magic. The Order struct is just a shell around some primitive Rust types. The rustc_serialize crate has already implemeted Encodable for pretty much all the primitive types. As such, the compiler has enough information to automatically implement the RustcEncodable trait for the Order struct. If we had used a type that did not already implement Encodable, then the compiler would have thrown an error.\nNote: If you are wondering why we derive RustcEncodable to automatically implement the Encoding trait, know that the rustc_serialize crate used to be part of the std library, was deprecated and migrated out to crates.io. In order for the rustc_serialize crate not to clash with the code still in the stdlib, the name we derive was modified. You can look to this commit for more details. This is a unique case. In the vast majority of cases, the name of the trait and the name of the trait we are deriving are the same.\nDatabase Connection\nWe are now ready to setup our database connection. Based on the Postgres connection information provided during the Preparation section, we can create a database url. We then create a Connection object that represents our connection to the Postgres database. Using the SslMode enum, we opt to make create the connection over plain-text.\n\nConnecting to the database can fail, so Connection::connect() is returning a Result type. Most examples you will see choose to .unwrap() the Result type, which would yield the connection on Ok or panic on Err. I will be using .expect() instead of .unwrap(). Using .expect() is just like using .unwrap() except that it allows for a more user-friendly error message if something goes wrong. This will help us debug any issues we may encounter, especially if you are modifying these exmaples.\nQuerying the Database\nLet us now jump down to our /orders route and replace the static json response with an actual database result. We create our SQL string to fetch rows from the orders table. We also need to create a mutable orders vector (array) to store the Order objects we are mapping. We then fire off the query by passing in our SQL string and any paramters we wanted to bind. In this case, we have no parameters to bind so we pass a reference to an empty slice (&amp;[]). We loop over each row in the result, manually convert the result into an Order struct and store it in the orders vector. After all the rows have been converted, we call json::encode() on the orders vector and return that result. Remember, we derived RustcEncodable on the Order struct. The rustc_serialize crate already implemented Encodable on the Vec too. The combination of all these Encodable trait implementations allows for the automatic serialization of orders using json::encode().\n\nSync Error\nBelow are all the changes we have made so far:\n\nIn our main function, we setup a connection to the database, create a nickel webserver and define our /orders route. Our /orders route calls a closure that uses the above database connection to fetch orders from the database and then serializes them into json. This looks pretty straight-forward, but if we try to compile this code we will get a rather initimidating error message. If we parse through multi-line error message, we can pull out two peices of information:\n\nerror: the trait core::marker::Sync is not implemented for the type core::cell::UnsafeCell&lt;postgres::InnerConnection&gt;\ncore::cell::UnsafeCell&lt;postgres::InnerConnection&gt; cannot be shared between threads safely\n\nHere in lies the beauty of Rust. The Connection object is not thread safe and, while it may not have been apparent, nickel serves requests in different threads. Rust only allows types that implement the Sync trait to be shared between threads. For a moment, let us be pragmatic about this. Rather than try and figure out how to make Connection thread safe we will just work around it by establishing the postgres connection as part of the /orders request.\n\nWe can now do cargo run and make a curl request in another window see our json response:\n\n\nFixing the Sync Error\nNow that we have a functioning webservice that connects to a Postgres database, let us stop and consider our approach. Making a connection per request may be fine for a database like MySQL, where connections are stateful and cheap to create, but not recommended for Postgres. We need to create a pool of connections that can be shared across the many different requests. Luckily for us, the creator of the postgres create also created a connection pool called r2d2 with a Postgres specific adapter. The connection pool internally uses a Mutex, which implements Sync, allowing the connections to be shared across threads.\nWe also need to consider how we are passing our connection pool to the request. The /orders route is implemented using a move closure, which will take ownership of the connection pool once we try to use it. If we create another route and try to use the connection pool, the compiler will throw an error because we now have two closures trying to take ownership of the same value. We need to take advantage of nickel middlware in order to properly share the connection pool. The nickel framework already provides nickel-postgres middleware for this very use-case.\nUsing Connection Pool Middleware\nWe need to add three more crates to Cargo.toml. The nickel_postgres crate requires a patch that has not been merged yet, so we are specifying a git revision. If/when the PR is accepted, I will update this section.\n\nOnce that is done, we need to import those three crates and then start specifying what parts of those crates we are going to use. The r2d2_postgres crate has a PostgresConnectionmanager that wraps the standard Connection struct provided by the postgres crate. The r2d2_postgres crate also provides a different SslMode enum (I am not sure why?), so we need to use that instead. This means we can get rid of the explicit postgres crate dependency and we can remove postgres = \"0.11.7\" from our Cargo.toml file.\n\nWe will be passing the PostgresConnectionManager into a Pool provided by the r2d2 crate. The Pool manages all of the complexity around sharing a fixed number of database connections across different threads. The PostgresConnectionManager implements the correct trait so the Pool can interact with Postgres connections. The Pool also accepts a Config struct that configures how the Pool will work. I chose to use the default settings, but you can customize it if you want a different number of connections.\nNow that we have our connection pool setup, we need to create the middleware. The PostgresMiddleware struct abstracts away all the details of how the middleware works. We only need to create the middleware and pass on our connection pool. You will also notice that we use PostgresRequestExtensions from nickel_postgres. This is a trait that makes it easier for us to get a connection from the pool when inside of our request.\n\nWhen each request comes in, the middleware will put a reference to the connection pool on the request object. We can use request.db_conn(), made possible by the PostgresRequestExtensions trait, to get a database connection from the pool. Now we can use that connection just like we were before. Once our request goes out of scope, the connection will automatically be returned to the pool.\nTL;DR\nHere is our finished product:\n\nIt was a bit of a journey, but we now have a webservice that can properly make requests to a Postgres database and return the result as a json response. Our first attempt ran into a compiler issue when Connection did not implement Sync. We had to modify our orginal approach to fit within the rules that the Rust compiler enforces. That, briefly, meant creating a database connection per request. Realizing this approach was not recommended, we refactored our webservice to use a connection pool that provided thread safety. We also decided to use nickel middlware to expose the connection pool to each request. It added a bit more complexity to our code, but the tradeoff is that we are now guaranteed to be free of data races when serving requests on different threads.

The nom crate is written by Geoffrey Couprie, aka Geal, and is a remarkably complete and powerful library for building parsers. I recently did a lot of parsing of bytes on the wire for my carp library and it was a lot of work. I wish I had come across the nom library before I had done all of that.\nThe description of nom is a Rust parser combinator framework which can sound a little initimdating. Another way of saying this is that nom uses a lot of small functions and macros that make parsing code easy to write and read. I will say that nom can be a bit intimidating to start using. The API has a lot of surface area to learn and the error messages can be hard to understand. The cryptic error messages are due to the use of macros and not anything specific to nom. While it can take a little bit of effort to get started using nom, but I think it is well worth it.\nParsing Text\nThe nom library can parse pretty much anything, but let us start with text. When parsing text, we might be tempted to reach for something like regular expressions. This is an alternative approach that leverages Rust's typing. Also, nom is probably faster and more efficient than any regular expression we might write. The first thing to understand about nom is that it only deals in byte arrays (&amp;[u8). Our text to parse will most likely be in the form of a string. We can convert a string to a byte array using .to_bytes(). To get usable results from our parser, we must convert (or map) a matched sequence of bytes into the type that we want. Knowing this, let us start looking at how to parse text input.\nThe bread and butter of our parsing is going to be the use of the tag! and map_res! macros. The tag! macro consumes the specified string from the byte array. For example, if we had a string of \"hello Herman\", we would specify tag!(\"hello\") to parse out the first word. The tag! macro works great when we know what string we want to match. It does not work for dynamic strings. The map_res! macro will be used for dynamic input.\nWe have to write a more abstract parser for dynamic strings. We can parse the \"Herman\" part of the string using the alpha function. The alpha function is provided by nom and will return the longest list of alphabetic characters it finds as a byte array. If it is dynamic, it probably means this is part of the input we want to capture. Getting back a byte array of &amp;['H', 'e', 'r', 'm', 'a', 'n'] is not ideal work with. We want to convert that into a string. Using map_res! we can map (convert) the byte array into a string: map_res!(alpha, std::str::from_utf8). The map_res! (map result) macro is known as a combinator. We are combining the alpha function with the std::str::from_utf8 function. The std::str::from_utf8 function is part of the Rust standard library and converts a slice of bytes (or a byte array) into a UTF8 encoded string. So map_res!(alpha, std::str::from_utf8) is saying that we want to grab the longest array of alphabetic characters and then we want to pass that byte array of alphabetic characters to the std::str::from_utf8 function.\nNow that we can parse both parts of hello Herman, we can put it all together into a more complex parser:\n\nIn the above example, we are using the named! macro to create a parser function named name_parser. We specify the &amp;str type as the return type of our parser. We use the chain! combinator macro to apply a series to parsers and assemble their results. We use the ~ character as the separator between parser functions/macros and a , to denote the end of the parser chain. The last part of the chain! combinator takes a closure, || name, where we can use the previously defined name variable. We now have a function name_parser that accepts a string that begins with hello, has one or more spaces and then contains a series of alpha characters. We map those alpha characters into a string and assign that value to a variable called name. Finally, we return name from the closure, which will be the &amp;str our function returns. Here is a test case proving it:\n\nNotice that the name_parser function does not actually return a &amp;str. It actually returns an IResult type that represents whether the parsing is Done, Incomplete or an Error. If the parsing was successful, the result will be IResult::Done(input_remaining, output). In our above test, there is no more input left so the byte array is empty. The output is our &amp;str containing the dynamic name.\nThis might seem like a lot of work for such a basic parser. However, this is building a foundation for creating a lot more complex parsers. For example, we can now create a parser to convert a string of numeric characters into a number:\n\nAnd we can even go a step further and separate the parsing of a numerical array into a smaller parser called numeric_string. We can then map the result of numeric_string into a usize type in the usize_digit parser function:\n\nNow that we have a generic parser to parse numerical arrays, we can also create a parser to parse a string into a u64 using the same numeric_string function defined above:\n\nYou start to see how powerful the combination of small parsers can be. Not only does nom make it easy to write parsers, I think it also makes it easy to read parsers later and understand what they are doing. It also makes it easier to write tests against smaller parsers to verify their correctness. We have just scratched the surface of what nom can do. There are many other parsers and combinators available. There are also a number example parsers to use as a reference.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/08/08/introduction-to-nom-rust-parsing-combinator-framework.html/","title":"Introduction to nom: a parsing framework written in Rust"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/09/12/rust-using-and_then-and-map-combinators-on-result-type.html/":{"body":"If you have spent any amount of time learning Rust, you quickly become accustomed to Option and Result types. It is through these two core types that we make our programs reliable. My background is with C and dynamic languages. I found it easiest to use the match keyword when working with these types. There are also combinator functions like map and and_then which allow a set of computations to be chained together. I like to chain combinators together so error logic is separated from the main logic of the code.\nI recently returned home from RustConf 2016 where the futures crate had a 0.1.1 release along with the first glimpses of tokio. All futures implement a poll function that returns a Poll type. The Poll type is defined as pub type Poll&lt;T, E&gt; = Result&lt;Async&lt;T&gt;, E&gt;;. ~~Thus, if we want to use futures, we need to be comfortable with combinator functions implemented on the core Result type. You will not be able to fall back on using the match keyword.~~Many of the examples that I have seen used combinator functions to chain futures together. We can look at how and_then and map combinators work on the Result type and get a better understanding of how combinators work without the additional mental load of trying to understand how futures work. Once we are comfortable with combinators, we should be better able to understand the examples that use combinators to chain futures together. (Edit: Revised the previous sentence per the discussion on r/rust).\nApproach\nI will be providing explicit types throughout the examples to make it easier to understand what is happening. In the vast majority of cases, you can let compiler infer the types. In fact, it is idiomatic to let the compiler infer the types.\nThe Standard Library API Reference for Result combinators does a good job with explanations and simple examples. However, most examples use the same type for both the Ok and Err variants. I think this makes it harder to understand what is going on. I will be using a Err(&amp;'static str) variant the examples so I can use easy to identify error messages. If the 'static lifetime confuses you, know that &amp;'static str means hard-coded string literal. Example: let foo: &amp;'static str = \"Hello World!\";.\nand_then Combinator\nLet us start with the and_then combinator function. The and_then combinator is a function that calls a closure if, and only if, the variant of the Result enum type is Ok(T).\n\nIn this first example, the value of res is Ok(5). Per our definition of and_then: and_then will match on the Ok variant and call the closure with the usize value of 5 as the argument. What happens if res is an Err variant?\n\nIn this second example, the value of res is Err(\"error\"). Per our definition of and_then: and_then will match on the Err variant and skip calling the closure. The value of Err(\"error\") will be returned as is. This is convenient as we were able to write a closure that ignored errors. The value Err(\"error\") will be passed along in the background to the end of the combinator chain. So far we have only been returning Ok from closure. Our closure can also return an Err too.\nChaining Multiple and_then Functions\nInstead of multiplying, let us divide 2 by the result n. To protect against division by zero errors, we need to add another step in the chain that will return an error if the value is zero.\n\nThe initial value of Ok(0) will be passed to the first closure. In this case, n does equal 0 and the closure returns Err(\"cannot divide by zero\"). Our next call to and_then identifies that we now have an Err variant of Result and does not call the closure.\nFlattening Results\nThere are times when we have nested Result types. It is generally a good strategy to try and flatten the result out. For example, we can flatten Result&lt;Result&lt;usize, &amp;'static str&gt;, &amp;'static str&gt; to Result&lt;usize, &amp;'static str&gt;. A flatter Result is generally easier for later code to deal with.\n\nIn the above example, the first and_then closure is returning n. Note that in previous examples, we were wrapping our return value in either the Ok or Err variant of the Result enum. In this example, our goal is to flatten the result so we will not explicitly return Ok or Err. The value of n is going to be either Ok(usize) or Err(&amp;'static str). As such, we can return n as it is. If the value of n is of type Ok(usize) then the value will be passed to the next and_then as expected. If the value of n is of type Err(&amp;'static str) then the second and_then function will be bypassed.\nThe and_then function is called flatMap in scala and you can see why. We are flattening the type from Result&lt;Result&lt;_, _&gt;, _&gt; to Result&lt;_, _&gt; by mapping variants in the internal Result to the outer Result.\nmap Combinator\nSo far we have been using and_then to combine computation and flatten our nested Results. The examples have been using Results with types that are the same types we wanted to end up with. Sometimes we are given a Result where one or both variants are not the type we want. We will use map to transform one Result type into another.\nBasics\nIf you primarily use a dynamically typed language, you may have used map as a replacement for iterating/looping over a list of values. We can do this same thing in Rust too.\n\nUsing map with a Result type is a little different. The map function calls a closure if, and only if, the variant of the Result enum is Ok(T). Here is our very first and_then example, but using map instead.\n\nThis looks very similar to the first and_then example, but notice that we returned Ok(n * 2) in and_then example and we are returning n * 2 in this example. The map function always wraps the return value of the closure in the Ok variant.\nMapping the Ok Result Variant To Another Type\nLet us look at an example where the Ok(T) variant of the Result enum is of the wrong type. Example: We are given Result&lt;i32, _&gt;, but we want Result&lt;usize, _&gt;.\n\nIn this example, the value of res is Ok(5i32). Per our definition of map, map will match on the Ok variant and call the closure with the i32 value of 5 as the argument. When the closure returns a value, map will wrap that value in Ok and return it.\nIf the given value is an Err variant, it is passed through both the map and and_then functions without the closure being called.\n\nMapping Both Variants of Result\nWhat if both variants of the Result were different? Example: We are given Result&lt;i32, MyError&gt;, but we want Result&lt;usize, &amp;'static str&gt;.\nWe only transform the Ok(i32) variant in the above example. In this example, we will need to also transform the Err(MyError) variant into Err(&amp;'static str). In order to do this, we will need to use map_err to handle the Err(E) variant. The map_err combinator function is the opposite of map because it matches only on Err(E) variants of Result.\n\nYou must understand that:\n\nmap only handles the Ok(T) variant of Result\nmap_err only handle the Err(E) variant of Result\n\nDifferent Return Types Using and_then And map\nThe and_then, map and map_err functions are not constrained to return the same type inside their variants. The map functions can be given Ok(T) and return Ok(U). The map_err function can be given Err(E) and return Err(F). The and_then function can be given Ok(T) and return Ok(U) or Err(F)!\nLet us try a complicated example where we are given a nested Result, but none of the types match the desired types we want. Example: We are given Result&lt;Result&lt;i32, FooError&gt;, BarError&gt;, but we want Result&lt;usize, &amp;'static str&gt;.\n\nI decided to inline the explanation into the comments in an effort to make things as clear as possible. You can see how quickly things get complicated. It is my general strategy to try and flatten the nested Result out as early as possible to simplify later combinators.\nConclusion\nA lot of functions return Result to represent the happy-path value and the error case. Using combinators can help isolate error handling from normal computation. Combinators also allow us to pass along errors all the way to the end. I like the Railway Oriented Programming for a good visualization of this concept. All the examples we went through work on the Option type too. You should now be better equipped to read other code that uses Result combinator functions and writing them yourself.\nExtras\nor_else Combinator\nThe or_else function combinator is the opposite of and_then. It only calls the closure if the result is Err(E). I do not find myself using or_else as often as and_then. Please feel free to show me what I am missing.\nDebugging Complex Combinators\nI like to make types explicit when trying to get a complex combination working. However, this can get unrealistic when dealing with iterators or futures that become deeply nested. When that happens, I start assigning results to incorrect types. Here is a small example, assuming I am confused as to what type res is:\n\nWhich generates:\n\nI normally use the variable c because I want to see the type of res in the compiler error message. Haha, I know.\nHere is an example using it in a combinator:\n\nWhich generates:\n\nThe compiler errors show both the expected input and expected output. I find this really useful when I get lost in all the combinators.\nNightly Error Format\nAs of this writing, Rust 1.11.0 is the stable version. Rust 1.11.0 does not have the new error format that is present in Rust nightly. If I am struggling on a compiler error, I often switch over to using Rust nightly until I solve the error. Rustup makes this easy.\nIn your current working directory:\n\nSwitch to nightly - rustup override set nightly\nSwitch to stable - rustup override set stable\n\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2016/09/12/rust-using-and_then-and-map-combinators-on-result-type.html/","title":"Using and_then and map combinators on the Rust Result Type"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2017/02/15/weldr-reverse-proxy-initial-release-rust.html/":{"body":"Note: This project was originally named alacrity.\nOver the past few months I have been working on a building a reverse proxy, called weldr, in Rust. I have just published the initial release of weldr. I have been interested in doing something with networks in Rust. I have spent a lot of time building hypermedia APIs, so doing something with HTTP seemed like a good fit. I started out using mio and later switched to tokio. While this was fun to do, I quickly realized that I was spending most of my time implementing the HTTP spec instead of building the features I was most excited about. The hyper HTTP library was also switching over to tokio and way ahead of where I was at. After talking with Sean, I made the decision to use hyper as the foundation for weldr moving forward. There are still a number of things a proxy must do in order to conform with the various HTTP related RFCs. I will be working on those proxy specific requirements while adding the features that I want in a reverse proxy.\nThere are two general problems I am trying to solve with weldr. The first problem is that popular open source proxies do not work as well as I would like them to in dynamic cloud/container environments. The reason is that dynamic parts of a proxy, such as the list of backend servers, are defined by a configuration file that is read when the proxy is started. I want to build a proxy that has a minimal configuration file and drive most of the behavior through a set of APIs. This may make it harder to use weldr for simple use cases, but I hope weldr can make more complex environments a lot easier. I will note that there are some products that do this now, such as NGINX Plus, but those are cost prohibitive for many.\nThe second, more aspirational, problem is around the availability of the proxy. If I want to put a reverse proxy in front of a critical cluster of web servers, I have two basic options: use an active/passive setup or use DNS. For an active/passive setup, the go to is keepalived. I think keepalived does a great job, but it is a real pain to setup and ensure it is working correctly. Even more so if you are trying to automate the creation of servers. I want to start mulitple weldr proxy servers and have them automatically determine a leader with one or more followers. This means that keepalived kind of logic must be embedded inside weldr. I plan on using Raft to accomplish this. The current Rust raft library is missing some features that I require though. I hope to contribute those at some point in the future. The other solution, DNS, is even more challenging to get working correctly. It may be necessary though in order to handle a large number of requests. I have some very early thoughts about making this work better as well. I hope to write about those thoughts more in the future.\nWeldr is definitely not production ready, but it is working well enough that you can play with it.

It also added a fair amount of complexity to the code.\nBefore discussing the solution, I want to review the problem I was trying to solve. With asynchronous IO, the state of the connection and the events may get out of sync. I kept running into problems where I was processing events and would discover the connection was no longer present in the slab. This would cause mob to panic instead of resetting that connection and moving on. Here is one example of how this might happen:\n\nmio: blocks on poll\nclient: client sends some data\nmio: receives read event for connection A\nmio: receives write event for connection A\nmio: unblocks and returns 2 events\nmob: read event is processed, there is an error and connection A is removed from slab\nmob: write event is processed, connection A cannot be found and results in a panic\n\nI needed to not panic when connection A was not present in the slab. You can read that previous post for the details on the scheme I concocted to work around this issue. Looking at it now, it is clear to me that I did not fully understand Rust's ownership model and was partially working around that. I was also not clear on how mio (epoll/kqueue) were sending events.\nOwnership Problems\nI have a function that, given a token, would find the corresponding connection in the connection slab. It looks like this (and used to be named find_connection_by_token):\n\nThis function takes &amp;mut self because it needs to return a mutable reference to the Connection. When I first started writing mob, I did not yet have a good mental model on how to write Rust programs. I fought the borrow checker constantly because I would try to assign the connection to a variable, let conn = self.connection(token);, only to have the compiler tell me this mutable reference was preventing me from using the connection function again later on in the code. It is now clear to me that I should have structured my code to keep all the connection logic in one place and not try to call self.connection(token) from different functions. I was used to working in garbage collected (GC) languages and C, which have no problems if you have multiple mutable references to objects. I also did not have a clear enough mental model of how mio was working in order to design the code to keep the connection logic in one place. In mio v0.4.x, you had to implement the Handler trait which forced a certain kind of design on the code.\nI did not want to rewrite large parts of mob to remove the connection state though. To make some progress in the short-term, I made sure my code never kept a reference to a connection object. To do this, I made sure to always chain calls when using the connection object. Something like this:\n\nThis allows me to call self.connection() all over my code without hold on to that reference and causing ownership problems. I still think it is a good idea to refactor the code to separate the details of mio and the domain logic of mob, but that is for another time.\nHow Events Are Triggered\nIt is helpful to understand the difference between level-triggered and edge-triggered events before reading the below explanations. Mob receives edge-triggered events. If you are not clear what level-triggered vs edge-triggered means, I suggest you read the section in mio::Poll that discusses helps define these two terms. If you want even more detail, I suggest reading Epoll is fundamentally broken 1/2 and Epoll is fundamentally broken 2/2. Despite the sensational titles, the author of these blog posts goes through multiple examples of different types of triggering. All three of these links focus on read events. I was fuzzy about how a write event is triggered. I originally thought that it had something to do with the client making a call to read. My current understanding is that the events are triggered based on the changing state of the read and write kernel buffers for that connection (or socket).\nThe kernel read buffer starts out empty. At some point the kernel receives some data from the client, the kernel writes that data to the read buffer and a read event is triggered. The read buffer is now in a state of non-empty. If the kernel receives more data and writes it to the read buffer while it is in a state of non-empty, another event will not be triggered. Another read event will be triggered if, and only if, the kernel read buffer is in a state of empty and then data is written to it. If mob does not read all of the data, then the subsequent call to poll will appear to hang. What is happening is that poll will not receive another read event because the kernel read buffer is still in a non-empty state. This is why it is critically important than whenever mob receives a read event that it reads until it receives WouldBlock. This ensures the kernel read buffer is put back into a empty state and thus able to trigger another read event if it receives more data.\nWrite events are a little different because we usually do not have enough data to fill up the kernel write buffer until we receive WouldBlock. The kernel write buffer starts out in an empty state. When a connection registers for write, it will receive a write event due to the empty state of the buffer. The connection can then write some data, but in the mob case will most certainly not fill up the buffer as mob messages are quite small. The kernel write buffer is in a non-empty state and will not trigger another write event until the write buffer is empty. The kernel will then try to send the data to the client and once all the data is sent the kernel will trigger another write event (assuming the connection is still registered to receive write events). During the time between the initial write and the kernel sending the contents of the buffer, the connection is still allowed to write until it receives WouldBlock.\nTo round out my understanding, let us also briefly talk about the hangup (hup) event. The hup event works like read and write events. The connection is in an established state. When the client closes their end of the connection, the state changes to closed (or reset) and the connection will receive the hup event.\nSolution\nWith my improved understanding of ownership and a more accurate mental model of how the kernel sends events, the fix is pretty simple. Before processing any events, make sure the connection is in the slab. The diff of the change is here. Most of the changes are removing code, so let me walk through the important parts.\n\nThe self.token is the token for the server and is not present in the slab. The slab is indexed by the tokens, so self.conns.contains() is a constant time lookup. Much better than iterating through a list of connections. I am not quite done though. If the connection encounters some error, I need to remove it from the slab. To do this I replaced self.find_connection_by_token(token).mark_reset(); with self.remove_token(token);.\nIn hindsight, this was a pretty obvious change to make. Some comments in the reddit post on managing the connection state were trying to explain this to me, but I did not get it at the time. There are a few other things in mob that this same pattern of an original naive solution where I now see an obvious improvement to make. I hope to make those changes as well to continue to diff my mindset between 2015 and now.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2018/03/29/removing-connection-state-from-mob.html/","title":"Removing Connection State In mob"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2019/03/31/lucet-in-five-minutes.html/":{"body":"Lucet is Fastly's native WebAssembly compiler and runtime. I am a big fan of Rust, Fastly and WASM. Especially WASM on the server via WASI. I jumped right in and tried to get my own lucet program running, but the setup is a rather long process. My plan was to introduce lucet to some colleagues at my local Rust meetup. I am a huge fan of Rust, but the compile times are an issue. Spending 30 minutes on setup was a non-starter. I was excited when I saw that Fastly published a Docker container:\nThe Fastly Lucet image is now available on the Docker Hub. `docker pull fastly/lucet` and you’re all set.— Frank Denis (@jedisct1) March 28, 2019\n\nHowever, this container was built for people developing on lucet. The container has all of the required dependencies, but still requires the same initial setup process. So, I decided to take advantage of Docker's multi-stage build process to create a container that has lucet already built. It comes in at the slim size of 107 MB, which should make it fast to download.\nHere is how you can get lucet running a simple Hello World program in 5 minutes.\n\nThis docker container provides a version of clang capable of compiling to wasm via the wasm32-unknown-wasi-clang command. It is a not a requirement to compile your program to wasi using wasm32-unknown-wasi-clang in this docker container. The only requirement is that you compile the program to wasi before using lucetc-wasi. Also, take note that lucetc-wasi and lucet-wasi have very similar spellings, but are indeed two different programs.\nIf you are wondering why I did not demo converting a Rust program to WASI, we are blocked until wasm32-unknown-wasi is a valid target in rustup. As soon as that target is available, then I plan on creating another post showing how to get Rust + lucet working together. See WASI example using Rust and Lucet for a Rust example that runs on lucet.\nLucet is not 1.0 yet and I expect to be changing it a lot. As of this moment, the hjr3/lucet container is built against fastly/lucet commit e6b399b. As new changes come in, I will do my best to update the container. I may setup an automated process if this proves useful to people. I will tag each version against the fastly/lucet commit the container is built against.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/2019/03/31/lucet-in-five-minutes.html/","title":"fastly/lucet in five minutes"},"https://hermanradtke.com/2019/04/01/wasi-example-using-rust-and-lucet.html/":{"body":"Lucet is Fastly's native WebAssembly compiler and runtime.

A lot of articles and advice focus on initial startup, which can be thought of as acceleration. We should also consider, what happens after we are done accelerating, how easy it is to maintain our velocity.\n\nLook, I am biased towards fast startup times. Here is my zsh startup time:\n\nI am open and close my my shell quite often. As a result, my shell configuration is fairly minimal. I generally omit features, like custom completions, to achieve this. This is not the only way people work.\nWhen I pair with some of my colleagues, I observe that they have a different style of working. They open VS Code and then open a single shell within the VS Code UI. They usually leave VS Code open all day and use that one shell. The initial startup time of VS Code and the the shell within VS Code is not that important to them. What is important to them is how easily they can maintain their productivity level of the course of the day.\nPeople that have a long-loved shell, are probably better off adding additional functionality, such as custom completions. These additional features help maintain their productivity velocity. My suggestions to them about improving their shell startup time will often seem unimportantto them. They are optimizing for a different outcome than I am.\nA while back, I switched from vim to neovim. Prior to the switch, I kept my vim configuration pretty minimal to avoid slowing down vim's startup time. I sacraficed some of the more advanced, heavier plugins as a result. I was fine with this trade-off. Neovim makes it much easier to lazy-load plugins, which allows me to maintain a fast startup time while also providing me access to features, such as languages servers.\nI am not lazy loading anything in zsh. Maybe I should? I found zsh-lazyload from a quick Google search, but I have not looked into it closer. I know fish has autoloading function which is basically lazy loading. The downside of lazy loading approaches is the additional complexity. I will only consider lazy loading things in my shell if it is relatively straight-forward and a first-class concern of the shell.\nI like the How fast is your shell? article because it matches my own development style. I also try to keep in mind that others have styles of working that require a different set of optimizations.

If we are coming from a dynamic language, such as Node.JS, we may want to a solution like fetch-mock which will patch the implementation of fetch at runtime. This is not practical in Rust. There are some attempts, like the hotpatch crate, but we will use a different strategy.\n\nThe complete code for this post can be found at: https://github.com/hjr3/the-cat-api-http-mocks\nCalling The Cat API\nLet us start with an example. We will write a program to make search for cat breeds using The Cat API. First, let us discover how this API works. Reading the docs for GET /breeds/search we can search for breeds using the q query parameter. Using curl, we can try this out:\n\n\nNow that we know how to make a request and what the shape of the response looks like, we can write a program. We will use the reqwest crate to make our HTTP requests. I will opt for blocking behavior to avoid any async type juggling.\n\nNote: The serde_json crate allows us to define a subset of the response. I only specified a few fields in Breed for brevity.\nIf we run our program, we should see something like:\n\nCreate Mocks Using Traits\nNow, we want to test our program without making an actual HTTP request. We can use a trait to define the types of requests we can make. We will define a trait called TheCatApi and then implement a concrete TheCatApiClient type.\n\nNow our main function looks like this:\n\nIf we run our program, we should get the same output above.\nNow that we have a TheCatApi trait, we can also implement a mock client. We use the output from our curl request above and implement the search_breeds function to deserialize the JSON.\n\nYou can also shorten this up by doing BreedResponse { id: \"sibe\", name: \"Siberian\" } but for real world examples I find it easier to paste the JSON string.\nNow we can wire up some tests. In this simple case, we are only testing that we implemented the BreedResponse type and Breed struct correctly.\n\n\nAnd we should also test a decoding failure to make sure we are testing what we expect.\n\nNotice that I put the mock client implementation inside the test function. If we define it outside the test function, then each mock needs a unique name.\nInjecting Traits As Dependencies\nThis is all good but we have side stepped a big part of implementing this strategy in a real program. A big reason people reach for testing libraries like fetch-mock is because they have no other way to tell their function to use a different implementation of fetch. Indeed, we need to structure our program to inject dependencies. I mostly write web servers, so let us create a simple web server for a more real world example. Our web server will accept a request to search for breeds and then use our implementation of TheCatApi trait get the data. I am going to use rocket.rs as it has really good docs. I will also be using the v0.4 version, which is blocking. Be aware that the v0.4 version requires the nightly compiler.\nWhen we create our web server, we want to inject our dependencies. Specifically, we want to inject TheCatApiClient. We can do this in rocket.rs by using the manage method. This will allow us to access the client from the request handler.\n\nNow we can run our server\n\nand make a request\n\nNow that we have a working web server that makes requests to The Cat API, we want to write a test for our get_breed handler. The rocket.rs framework makes this fairly straight-forward as client is a parameter to get_breeds. We will need to change the type of client from the concrete implementation of TheCatApiClient to a type that will allow us to use any implementation of the TheCatApi trait. There are two ways to do this: generics and boxed traits. Unfortunately, rocket.rs does not allow us to use generic functions. If we try to write a generic function, then we will get a compiler error.\n\nSo, boxed traits it is! We only create one instance of our API client when our program runs, so it creating our client on the stack or heap does not make much of a difference.\n\nWe need to update our main function as well.\n\nNow our get_breed function can accept any implementation of TheCatApi trait. We have one more thing to do before we can write our test. Notice that the client type in get_breed is State&lt;Box&lt;dyn TheCatApi&gt;&gt;. We need some way of creating that State type. The rocket.rs docs have a Testing with State section that gives us the hint. So, to make this work we will need to extract the set up logic for our web server out of the main function. We create a setup function that allows us to pass in an implementation of TheCatApi trait.\n\nWith that in place, we can write a test that allows us to ensure get_breed succeeds.\n\nWe can also create a mock client that fails.\n\nFurther Discussion\nStructuring our application this way makes it easier to inject dependencies. I tend to inject any dependency that is accessing the network or file system. This includes common parts of a web server like databases, loggers, tracing and API clients. The benefits go beyond testing.\nWhen serverless computing came onto the scene, many developers would write their serverless function in such a way that it could only run in the cloud. This created painfully long dev cycles where each change would take 30 seconds to upload to the cloud to verify. Some folks reached for complex solutions like serverles framework that tried to emulate the behavior of the cloud. It may have been better to design the application to accept a Server trait. We could implement that trait to work for hyper.rs and to work for the cloud implementation. Our dev cycle is now much faster and has less complexity than an emulated system.\nThis starts to look like Hexagonal architecture. We define traits for our network and filesystem dependencies so we can change the behavior of the system. Do not go overboard on this pattern. I tend to implement a trait when the need arises. I also like the Boundaries talk by Gary Bernhardt.\nCriticism and Alternatives\nOne downside to this approach is that we are not testing the actual implementation of search_breeds. We may have a bug in our code that does not show up in our tests. It is important that we keep our search_breeds function as small as possible to mitigate this downside.\nIf testing the actual implementation of search_breeds is a real concern, then we want to reach for libraries like httptest. This will define a local web server that can be configured to return specific responses. If we have other types of dependencies, like a database, then we can look for an in-memory implementation of that database. There is no silver bullet solution, so pick the option that best suits your needs.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/how-to-mock-functions-that-have-external-http-requests/","title":"How To Mock Functions That Have External HTTP Requests"},"https://hermanradtke.com/landing-page-router-using-fastly-edge-compute-wasm/":{"body":"A company often has a landing page for first time visitors that is optimized for describing and educating that person on what product or service the company is offering.

There are two common approaches to solving this problem that both have pitfalls. I want to explore a third option using Fastly's Compute@Edge offering.\n\nHere are the two common approaches to serving different content when a user visits the company website:\n\nA user browses to the index page of our website. That HTTP request is sent to our server and some server side language (Node.JS, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc) checks if some cookie exists and serves the appropriate page. The problem is that we can now no longer cache this page. Also, landing pages are usually static. It would be nice not use a static landing page or at least one that can be cached for a very long time.\nAnother option is to serve always the same landing page user browses to the index page of our website. We can cache this page at the edge for a very long time. Once the page loads, we can use JavaScript to check if some cookie exists and redirect the user to the more functional page. The problem is that a returning user will often see the marketing landing page flicker before they are redirected to the more functional page. Even if we put the JavaScript high up in the &lt;head&gt; element and try to prevent the flicker, we have a more subtle problem. We responded with a bunch of content that we immediately through away. This is wasteful and if we have a lot of people visiting our website, the bandwidth adds up.\n\nA third option I want to explore is to perform this logic in the CDN itself. A user browses to the index page of our website and that HTTP request first goes to our CDN. We have some compute that checks for some cookie and serves the appropriate page. Since we are still within the CDN, those pages are served from the CDN cache. We are going to use Fastly as our CDN. Now, we could do this check in Fastly's VCL itself.

We recently noticed some servers in the cluster were running much slower than others. We had used 0x in the past to profile Node.js services locally. In this case, we could not identify the problem locally and needed a solution to profile Node.js in production to identify the cause of the slowdown.\n\nTo profile in production, I wanted to expose a route that would enable profiling for a short amount of time and then give us access to the results. Working with another engineer, we decided on the following requirements:\n\nthe route would only be accessible through an internal port because our application was internet facing\nthe data would be returned as part of the route when the profiling was finished\n\n\n  Node and package versions used in this article\n\nnode - 18.12.0\nexpress - 4.18.2\nv8-profiler-next - 1.10.0\n\n\nSetup\nLet us create a simple express app that represents the Node.js service we want to profile.\n\nInternally Enable Profiling at Runtime\nI use node --prof /path/to/main.js when profiling locally. I use 0x which calls the application using the --prof flag and automatically generates a flamegraph. The problem is that we want to profile a running service in production for a few seconds.\nWe found two packages on npm that can enable profiling at runtime\n\nhyj1991/v8-profiler-next\nnode-inspector/v8-profiler\n\nAfter reading https://github.com/node-inspector/v8-profiler/issues/137, we chose v8-profiler-next because our Node.js is running node v20.\nOur production Node.js service is internet facing. We only want our new profiling route available on our internal VPN. Our example express app listens for requests on port 8000, which we can pretend is our public port. We create a separate express app listening on port 8001.\n\n\n  Entire main.js file\n\n\nWe set v8Profiler.setGenerateType(1); to use the new tree profiling format. Most modern tooling that analyzes CPU profiles prefer this format.\nThe /profile route will enable profiling and then return the output. We allow a timeout query parameter to control how long the profiling would run. We want to minimize the amount of time we profile for two reasons:\n\nprofiling slows the service down\nthe output can get quite large\n\nOur production service receives a lot of traffic, so a few seconds of profile output was more than enough to start analyzing.\nWe give each profile a name so we do not get them confused. Our example app uses myapp-${Date.now()}.cpuprofile. You may also consider including the host name in the filename if available. The .cpuprofile  extension is the convention for profiling output.\nAfter the profile is complete, the profile output is sent back in the response. We use res.attachment to add the Content-Disposition header to the response to indicate the content should be downloaded and saved locally.\nProfiling the Service\nWe first start our Node.js application using node main.js.\nWe can call our application public routes on port 8000\n\nWe can profile our application using port 8001\n\n\nThe --remote-name option instructs curl to save that data into a local file instead of writing to stdoout.\nThe --remote-header-name option instructs curl to use the Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL.\nThe --silent option instructs curl to disable the progress meter. This is my personal preference and not required.\n\nInternal Port in Production\nIn order to use profile in production, we need to:\n\nidentify the server we want to profile\nget network access to send a request to that server\n\nIn our case, our Node.js service emits telemetry that is aggregated into dashboards. Using these dashboards, we were able to identify which servers were using more CPU than the others.\nOnce we identified the server, we were able to vpn into the production network and use some kubectl commands to send requests a specific server on a specific port.\nAnalyzing the CPU Profile Using Flamegraphs\nWe spent some time searching for the best way to view the results as a flamegraph. I was used to 0x handling this by default. I liked the output of 0x but I did not want to hack the code to render the results for an external file.\nA lot of the suggestions I read said to use Chrome's Profile tab. Newer versions of Chrome no longer have this tab and I could not get the Performance Insights tab render my .cpuprofile files. Other suggestions were to manually convert the file into an svg image. A svg file is fine, but I wanted something a little better.\nI tried thlorenz/flamegraph but I received an error when I tried to use it and gave up after a few minutes.\nI happened to stumble upon jlfwong/speedscope which was exactly what I was looking for. It is easy to internally install and use. If you are working on open source you can use https://www.speedscope.app/.\nConclusion\nOnce we were able to view the .cpuprofile flamegraph's we quickly identified that our  Apollo Server - Subscription implementation for was the culprit. We were using davidyaha/graphql-redis-subscriptions to load balance subscriptions across the cluster and it was using a lot of CPU, possibly due to the use of async generators which have had known performance issues. We are using node v20 in production and supposedly those performance are fixed.\nThe issue was that when a particular server handled too many subscriptions, then it slowed way down. We are still investigating and changed implementations in the meantime. The cluster is now performing much better.\nAddendum\nstartProfiling Options\nI noticed the startProfiling function accepts three parameters:\n\nI could not find any documentation on what the recsamples and mode options did though. The default value for recsamples is true and for mode is 0.\nI dug through the code and eventually found the answer to recsamples in v8-profiler.h which says\n\n|record_samples| parameter controls whether individual samples should be recorded in addition to the aggregated tree\n\nI also found the answer to mode in cpu-profiler.cc which toggle for eager vs lazy logging.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/profiling-node-in-production/","title":"Profiling Node.js in Production"},"https://hermanradtke.com/projects/":{"body":"mob\nA multi-echo server built on mio.\nhal-rs\nA pure rust library for generating Hal responses.\nselecta-score-rs\nA more performant version of the selecta scoring algorithm.\nsoftnet-stat\nParse the /proc/net/softnet_stat file into something more readable.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://hermanradtke.com/proving-getenv-does-not-make-syscall/":{"body":"I saw this statement in an accepted answer on Stack Overflow:\n\nRetrieving the value of an environment variable will incur a system call.\n\nsource\nThis answer surprised me as I did not think this was the case.

While investigating some issues with dns.lookup, I noticed other people had run into this same issue but there was no one sharing what a solution might look like.\n\nNote: This post was significantly edited on November 6, 2022.\nIn a hurry? You can skip to the solution.\ndns.lookup Is Always Called\nLet us create a simple program to send a message via UDP. We can use a domain name with node:dgram, but it is bad idea. I explain why here. Let us assume we have a single IP address instead.\n\nWhen we run this program, we expect to bypass all calls to dns.lookup when we run our code.\n\nThis is surprising and we are not the only ones who think so. This behavior was first called out in nodejs/node#35130 but was dismissed with a won't fix response. It was brought up again in nodejs/node#39468 because (as the docs said above), we are still delayed by at least one tick of the event loop as shown in b3723fac05.\nAvoiding dns.lookup When Using IP Address\nTo avoid dns.lookup, we configure our socket to use a custom lookup function.\n\nThe hostname value will be the value of ip. Now, when we run it we will not see any calls made to dns.lookup.\n\nThe Value of hostname Is Not Always What We Expect\nWe might consider swapping out hostname for ip in the callback, but that will cause a problem.\n\n\nThe issue is that our socket.send first tries to bind to a local address (e.g. 0.0.0.0), which calls our custom lookup function. This is why our first example printed called dns.lookup twice: first for the local address and the second time for the host parameter of socket.send. Our custom lookup function returned 93.184.216.34 both times. The socket cannot bind to a non-local address like 93.184.216.34 and emitted an error that told us as much. Now that we know that our lookup function can be called in unexpected ways, let us change the function to bypass dns.lookup only when hostname matches our expected domain name.\nIf we want to be really safe, we can consider calling dns.lookup for any value of hostname other than ip.\n\nPreventing DNS Lookup in hot-shots StatsD Client\nNow that we know about custom lookup functions, we can apply this same approach to the hot-shots StatsD client. A recent patch made it possible to pass UDP socket options when creating the client. Since a399dda landed in v9.2.0 you can do:\n\nAddendum: Avoid Domain Names\nWe prefer UDP for sending data like metrics because it is fast. We do not want the overhead of TCP and we are fine dropping some connections. When using a domain name, the docs warn us:\n\nDNS lookups delay the time to send for at least one tick of the Node.js event loop.\n\nDepending on how fast our DNS server is, we may be delayed for much longer than one tick of the event loop. However, things actually get worse. In Implementation considerations, we are warned:\n\nThough the call to dns.lookup() will be asynchronous from JavaScript's perspective, it is implemented as a synchronous call to getaddrinfo(3) that runs on libuv's threadpool. This can have surprising negative performance implications for some applications, see the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE documentation for more information.\n\nThe getaddrinfo function is written in C. It is a blocking function, which would cause problems for our event loop. To prevent blocking, the call to getaddrinfo is made using an internal threadpool. From UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE:\n\nBecause libuv's threadpool has a fixed size, it means that if for whatever reason any of these APIs takes a long time, other (seemingly unrelated) APIs that run in libuv's threadpool will experience degraded performance.\n\nIf we are sending a lot of UDP messages, we absolutely do not want to be using domain names.\nDNS Caching\nWe may be forced to use a domain name if the IP address (or addresses) change. In that case, our best bet is to use some sort of DNS cache. Choosing a proper implementation is for another post. However, once we decide on an cache implementation, we can combine the DNS cache with our custom lookup function to avoid calling dns.lookup.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/send-udp-messages-in-nodejs-without-dns-lookup/","title":"Send UDP Messages in Node.js Without dns.lookup"},"https://hermanradtke.com/streaming-body-trailing-headers-axum-0-6/":{"body":"Hyper is designed to support streaming bodies. The current version of axum, v0.6, supports streaming a response. If we want to include trailers (sometimes called \"trailing headers\") then we need to implement our own custom body.\n\nCaveats:\n\nThe custom body implementation only works in axum 0.6, which uses http-body 0.4.4. The http-body crate changed in v1.0.0-rc.2. The concept is the same, but the custom StreamBody type will be different.\nTrailers are only supported in hyper using HTTP/2. You can monitor https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2719 for HTTP/1.1 support.\n\nIf you want to send trailer headers in HTTP/1.1 or you do not want to implement your own Body, please refer to Stream a Body With Trailers in hyper 1.0 and axum 0.7\nSet up\nIn order to send trailers, we need an axum server that uses HTTP/2. Also, most implementations of HTTP/2 require TLS. Let us start from axum/examples/tls-rustlls. This will give us a working HTTP/2 server that uses self-signed TLS certificates.\nWe need to make a few changes to the Cargo.toml in order for the example to work:\n\nWe can now verify our server working:\n\n\nStreaming Body\nBefore sending trailers, we need to change our handler function to stream a response. First, add tokio-stream as a dependency:\n\nWe then need to modify our imports:\n\nFinally, we can replace the existing handler with one that streams a body:\n\nWe spawn a task that will send hello..., wait 2 seconds and then send world. Hyper knows how to correctly process a stream, but does not know what do with the receiver from the mpsc::channel. We use tokio-stream to convert the receiver into a stream and use that as our response body.\nNote: HTTP/2 does not use a Transfer-Encoding header. You can add one, but hyper will properly strip it out.\nWe can test that our response is now streaming a body using curl.\n\nWith the --no-buffer flag, you should notice a pause between hello... and world.\nSending Trailers\nIn http-body v0.4.4, the Body trait has a poll_trailers method handles the sending of trailers at the end of the body. In axum v0.6, StreamBody always returns None:\n\nCustom StreamBody\nWe can start from axum's StreamBody implementation and add support for trailers.\nCopy the StreamBody implementation from axum to our server:\n\nWe need to make some changes to the import statments in src/stream_body.rs:\n\nRename crate to axum\nRemove use http::HeaderMap as axum re-exports this dependency\nAdd http::HeaderMap to the existing use axum { ... } import.\n\n\nWe then modify the StreamBody struct to include trailers. This will allow us to store the trailers in our response.\n\nWe also need to set trailers to None when creating a new stream:\n\nAdd a set_trailers method to StreamBody so we can add trailer headers from our response:\n\nFinally, modify poll_trailers to send any headers we set:\n\nUpdate Response\nNow that we have a StreamBody implementaiton that will send headers, we can update handler in src/main.rs to include trailers.\nUpdate the imports to use the StreamBody we just created:\n\nWe modify our response to include a header:\n\nNote: we must include a Trailers header that names the trailer headers we want to send.\nWe can use curl to verify that our trailer header is sent. Note that we must include the verbose flag, -v, in order to see the headers.\n\nNote: the &lt; chunky-trailer: foo is on the same line as hello...world because we did not buffer the body.\nYou can find the complete source code at https://github.com/hjr3/axum-trailers\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/streaming-body-trailing-headers-axum-0-6/","title":"Stream a Body With Trailers in axum 0.6"},"https://hermanradtke.com/streaming-body-trailing-headers-hyper-1-0-and-axum-0-7/":{"body":"Hyper supports sending HTTP/1.1 Chunked Trailer Fields as of v1.1.0. The http-body is now at v1.0 as well and uses frames to allow a stream to return data and trailers.\n\nWe were able to write trailer fields in Stream a Body With Trailers in axum 0.6 by using HTTP/2 and writing our own custom body implementation. The hyper ecosystem has expanded trailer support which makes it easier to send trailer fields on both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 without writing a custom body.\nSet up\nWe start with the basic Hello, World! server from the hyper guide. As of this writing, the guide basically implements this example.\nCargo.toml\n\nsrc/main.rs\n\nWe can now verify our server working:\n\n\nSend Trailer As Part of a Stream\nWe will now replace the hello handler with one that is both a streaming response and that includes a trailer field after the stream is finished.\nFirst, add tokio-stream as a dependency:\n\nWe then need to modify our imports:\n\nWe are replacing the Full body implementation with the StreamBody implementation. We also need to import the Frame type from the body to inform hyper what kind of streaming data is being sent. Last, we import tokio::sync::mpsc to send data across tasks and tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream in order to stream the output received from the task.\nOur handler will now look like this:\n\nThe types get complicated, so I chose to use some type aliases to make it easier to understand. The Data type is the data being produced by our task and will be sent over the mpsc::channel. The ResponseBody type is our stream of Data.\nWe create a bounded mpsc::channel to send data from a task we will spawn to the response. We spawn a task, which represents any data we want to stream. For this example, I am sending hello..., sleeping for 2 seconds and then sending world. We use Frame::data to tell hyper that these bytes are the chunked body. Once we are finished sending data, we can include trailer fields. I am sending back a header map containing a single trailer. We use Frame::trailers to tell hyper that these headers are the trailer fields.\nThe tokio_stream crate allows us to convert the receiving side of the mpsc::channel into a stream. We then create a StreamBody, which implements the Body trait hyper requires, from the receiving stream.\nFinally, we build our response. Hyper strictly follows the HTTP/1.1 spec and will only include chunked trailer fields that are specfied in the Trailer response header.We can use curl to verify that our trailer header is sent.\nThat is it! We can use curl to verify that our trailer header is sent:\n\nWe use the --raw flag to see the individual chunks and trailer fields returned from our server. The TE: trailers header is how the client informs the server that it is willing to recieve headers and is required in order for hyper to send the trailer fields.\nYou can find the complete source code at https://github.com/hjr3/axum-trailers/tree/hyper-send-trailers\nUsing axum and IntoResponse\nUsing axum provides us with a really nice quality of life improvement: IntoResponse. This trait allows us to omit a lot of the complicated types that start showing up when we have complex Body implementations and are using futures.\nWe can change our hello handler from\n\nto\n\nwhich is much easier to work with, especially when we start dealing with futures.\nTrailer Field Without Streams\nSuppose we want to send a trailer field without a stream. We can wrap our Body implementation with an adapter that allows us to send trailer fields using a future. I am going to use axum for this example to avoid any complex types.\nWe need to import BodyExt from the http_body_util crate. This trait allows us to call with_trailers on a type that implements Body.\n\nNext, we can use with_trailers to create a future that returns a header map:\n\nFinally, remember to update the Trailer field to specify the trailer2 header:\n\nWhen we send a client request, we will get back both headers:\n\none as part of our stream\na second one that comes from a separate future\n\n\nYou can find the complete source code at https://github.com/hjr3/axum-trailers/tree/axum-0-7\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/streaming-body-trailing-headers-hyper-1-0-and-axum-0-7/","title":"Stream a Body With Trailers in hyper 1.0 and axum 0.7"},"https://hermanradtke.com/talks/":{"body":"Velocity Conf Program Committee\n\n2017 New York Committee Member\n2017 London Committee Member\n2018 San Jose Committee Member\n2018 San Jose Leadership Sessions Track Host\n\nEdge transformations: a primer on Fastly's image optimization\nAbstract: Today, a staggering 64% of all web traffic (62% on mobile) is image content.

Is a no brainer to have an app? The panels next main focus can be how the audience can blend both HTML5 and apps into their mobile strategy, based on what is right for them.

It is relatively simple to get started using webhooks using HTTP and JSON. However, there a number of failure scenarios that developers should be aware of in order to make their webhook implementation robust.\nTerminology\nFor this post we are using the following terms:\n\nclient - A program that sends a webhook request.\norigin - A service that processes and responds to webhook requests.\n\nUnhealthy Origin\nThe client sends a valid request but receives a 500 HTTP response code (or any 5xx server error) from the origin. This is the most common failure mode.  The cause of the unhealthy origin may be do to an explicit change, such as deploying a new version of the origin service. The error may also be caused by an unhealthy service upstream of the origin, such as a databased used by the origin becomming unavailable.\n\nInvalid Request\nThe client sends a request that does not conform to the origin's specification. The may be due to incorrect or missing data from the HTTP body or the HTTP headers. For example: the request may be missing a Content-Type: application/json header or is sending a boolean as a string in the body { \"active\": \"true\" } instead of { \"active\": true }. This error may not always be the fault of the client. The origin may have been updated in such a way that that previous requests were successful, but new requests are not. For example: the origin did not require a Content-Type header but now does. Or the origin used to accept both \"true\" and true as valid boolean value but is now more strict.\n\nNetwork Error\nThe client sends a request to the origin but the request never reaches the origin. Network errors can happen whether we are sending the request over the internet or using a VPN tunnel. Modern networks are complex and there are many reasons why the network can fail:\n\ndns - When sending a webhook request using an URI (domain name), the client may not be able to determine the IP address. Example: the client is unable to resolve an IP address for the request URI.\ntcp - The network protocol underlying HTTP failed. Example: the origin has an unrecoverable error and issues a TCP reset.\nhttp - The error occurred within the HTTP protocol. Example: the client sent the request using HTTP/2 but the origin only understands HTTP/1.\n\nThe cause of the network failure may be related to the client, the origin or somewhere in between. For example: requests are normally sent over the internet which involves transiting through Comcast's network. If Comcast has an issue, the requests will be dropped until network operators re-route traffic to another provider, such as Level3.\n\nA network timeout error is a special case that we discuss below.\nOrigin Timeout\nThe client sends a request to the origin, but a timeout occurs. The timeout may be from the origin, often in the form of a 504 Gateway Timeout error. The client may also timeout after a certain amount of time.\nAccording to the client, a timeout is an error. However, the origin may have partially or completely processed the request. This makes it difficult for the client to know if it should re-send the request or not.\nTo understand why the origin would continue processing the request when a timeout occurs, we need to understand how HTTP requests are normally processed. Let us use an example where the origin receives a webhook request for updating inventory. When the origin receives that request, it will update a SQL database with the new inventory count. The origin will wait until the SQL update finishes and then send a response. If that update is blocked for a long time, the client may give up and timeout. The update finally succeeds and the origin attempts to send a response, however the client has already given up and the response cannot be sent. In this scenario, the client has recorded a timeout error but the origin has processed the request.\n\nOrigin Dropped Request\nThe origin responds with a 2xx HTTP response code but does not actually process the request. This is one of the more insidious failure modes because it is almost impossible for the client to detect. Worse still, this issue is normally discovered days or weeks after it first occurs.\nMany origins will synchronously process webhook requests. However, some origins choose to asynchronously process requests. This means the origin receives a request, writes a message to a queue for later processing and responds with a 2xx HTTP response code. The intention is for some other service to process the message in the queue. Unfortunately, the message may never get processed. The queue may drop the message, a service may encounter an error while trying to process the message or a service may fail to properly process the message and mistakenly mark the message as processed.\nThe false-positive of a successful response and the delay in detecting this issue makes this scenario one of the more challenging failure modes to resolve. Examples:\n\nThe client may no longer have access to the data to re-send the request.\nSome requests cannot be safely re-sent. For example: an old inventory update request should not be sent because a newer request already updated the inventory to the correct value.\n\n\nSimple, Not Easy\nThe concept of webhooks are simple, but it is not easy to properly implement webhooks in a way that is robust and dependable. If the above scenarios are not properly handled, a webhook implementation is at risk of data loss and will require a support team to resolve incidents. Some failure scenarios are not possible to defend against without first documenting the interface, including pre-conditions and post-conditions, that both the origin and client should adhere to.\nI am building a webhook proxy, called soldr, to make webhook implementations resilient to the failure scenarios discussed above.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/webhook-failure-scenarios/","title":"Webhook Failure Scenarios"},"https://hermanradtke.com/why-your-rails-like-framework-is-not-widely-used/":{"body":"Ruby on Rails defined the ethos of the web development community for many years. I have observed people trying to replicate \"Rails\" in other languages with very mixed results. I consider Laravel, ASP.NET and Phoenix successful rails-like frameworks. Python already has Django. Sadly Java, Kotlin, Scala, Node.js, Go and Rust all lack a widely adopted rails-like experience.\n\nI believe Ruby on Rails was successful because the creator had strong opinions and  expressed those options as conventions in the framework. In 2003, Rails was in stark contrast to the configuration-heavy frameworks that tried to be everything to everyone.\nWhen recently evaluating some frameworks that claim to be \"Ruby on Rails\"-like, I noticed responses from the framework creator(s) like:\n\nwe decided to not decide\n\nor\n\nup to each individual to make a choice\n\nLook, people giving away their code for free can do whatever they want. However, if your goal is to create a modern rails-like framework this is counter-productive. Rails means the framework author has strong opinions expressed as conventions so developers using the framework do not have to make a bunch of upfront decisions before they can get started.\nI think the fear is that our strong opinion will not hold up over time and we made the wrong decision. A developer is going to argue with us about it. Here is the thing: a developer that chooses to argue with you about a decision you made was never going to use your framework anyways. Block them. Maintain a learning mindset and remember that it is ok to be wrong on the internet. Also, saying \"no\" is a decision that is perfectly acceptable.\nSo, in the spirit of strong opinions and being wrong, below are my thoughts on what will make a modern rails-like framework successful.\nAuto-increment Keys Should Not Be IDs\nRails-like frameworks make heavy use of ORMs and the ActiveRecord pattern, which almost always means there is an auto-incrementing primary key for each database table. That was a fine default when Ruby on Rails was created in 2003 considering uuids were proposed in 2005, but we know better now. Letting a user enumerate all the keys in a table is a bad idea. Even if we properly secure our API, auto-increment keys still leak information. Seeing /orders/43534 tells me a lot. And no, starting the order id from some number greater than 1 is not a solution.\nUse a uuid. I am not going to argue about performance. Uuids are pretty fast, your database probably fits in RAM and if you do need to scale the database then something like a uuid affords us horizontal scaling options that are very hard to do with an auto-increment primary key.\nIf someone makes a strong case for the primary key being a ulid, nanoid or some other format then that works for me too. I also don't care if the decision is to create every table with an internal id that auto-increments and an external id that is a unique value. Maybe there is an even better solution I have not thought of. Great! I only care that the rails-like framework has decided, by default, the public API uses an id that is safe to share.\nAPI First\nA rails-like framework typically uses the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern. One big impediment to establishing conventions is that the \"view\" has been in a constant state of flux for years as the frontend ecosystem for web development has been fragmented with no clear winner. To make matters worse, the frontend space is much more diverse than it was in 2003. We now have mobile apps, TUIs, IoT, VR and many more interfaces. These frontends often have their own development stories that are not easily integrated with. The common denominator to all of these frontend interfaces is that they need an API. It is also exceedingly common to build APIs that are only called by other APIs. Focus on APIs first and worry about the view layer later.\nBeing API first is only part of the decision. We have multiple protocols to choose from: REST, GraphQL, gRPC and many more. We need a protocol that can be used for both public and private APIs. We know that public GraphQL APIs have adoption issues. Even Github failed to convince developers to use their GraphQL API. So, GraphQL is out. We also know that gRPC makes heavy use of HTTP/2 but the majority of websites still use HTTP/1.1. That being said, 96% of browser support HTTP/2 so gRPC could be a viable option. I think the main reason to continue to use a RESTful API is that every frontend supports RESTful APIs but not every frontend has the tooling to support gRPC.\nRESTful API Specification\nIf a modern rails-like framework is API first, then it must have an API specification. This specification should be able to generate great looking documentation as well. GraphQL and gRPC are both schema-first, but the typical RESTful API is woefully under-specified.\nWe can fix this by having the rails-like framework automatically create an OpenAPI specification that can be shared with others and/or used to create nice looking documentation. The OpenAPI spec should be generated from the code. I think dropshot and fastapi do a good job in this area. I am bearish on spec-first API development, but I am only too happy to be proven wrong.\nIs OpenAPI perfect? No. Is there a viable alternative? No. Is the OpenAPI specification much better than doing nothing? Yes.\nI considered RAML as an alternative but Salesforce owns it and we should only consider open specifications.\nModels From Upstream APIs\nScientifically poll developers and ask them what types of projects they dislike the most. I would bet a crisp $100 bill that \"third-party integrations\" is in the top 3. Why? A mentioned above, the typical RESTful API is woefully under-specified.\nMost frameworks models tightly couple their models to the database. Here is an idea: consume an OpenAPI spec to codegen the models. Now, our rails-like framework can both generate and consume OpenAPI spec. This means we can now easily compose applications built with this rails-like framework. Think of the flywheel! The more applications using this API first rails-like framework, the easier it is for developers to do integrations. Internal teams would quickly see this benefit. Imagine SaaS companies using it as a value proposition: \"our API is generated by rails-like framework and works seamlessly when consumed by that same rails-like framework\".\nThis approach also requires better tooling. Most API codegen tools produce low-quality code. My guess is that these tools try to handle every use case an OpenAPI document could have. Better tooling can be made by having strong opinions on what to support. For example, progenitor is purpose-built to codegen OpenAPI documents from the aforementioned dropshot framework.\nFeature First Structure\nMost frameworks use a layer-first structure. Our controllers, models and views are grouped together.\n\nAs the application grows in size, developers will accidentally couple the layers together making your monolithic application is difficult to scale and harder to refactor. Before we start arguing about monoliths vs micro-services, I want to suggest that we can start with a better default for our project structure: feature first.\nA feature-first structure might look something like:\n\nThe controllers, models and views are grouped together by feature. The flutter community is one group that is making feature-first a convention.\nNow, a feature first structure is no silver bullet. It is basically domain driven design and people make design mistakes all the time. I believe the upsides outweigh the downsides though. A feature first structure makes it harder to create accidental coupling. And when coupling is inevitably introduced, feature first makes it easier to refactor the code to remove that coupling. Finally, if you go monolith first a feature first structure makes it easier to extract parts of the monolith into separate services should scaling become an issue.\nA feature-first approach would almost certainly necessitate examples that show developers how to handle cross cutting concerns, such as authentication. These guides would focus on encouraging simple, local solutions that work for the feature, without forcing generalized abstractions that might not stand the test of time. Developers would grow comfortable with duplicating some code in order to avoid early abstractions. Avoiding premature generalization ensures that the development process stays agile and adaptable, even as the application grows. This approach also empowers teams to revisit abstractions when the patterns and needs become clearer, rather than guessing early and facing rigid, difficult-to-change systems down the road.\nMake Decisions for Modern Application Development\nA rails-like framework will almost certainly not be successful by simply cloning Ruby on Rails conventions as-is. Application development in 2003 was very different from application development today. Framework authors wanting adoption must establish new conventions that allow developers to get up and running quickly without making many decisions about setup while also avoiding common maintenance pitfalls.\n","id":"https://hermanradtke.com/why-your-rails-like-framework-is-not-widely-used/","title":"Why Your Rails-like Framework Is Not Widely
