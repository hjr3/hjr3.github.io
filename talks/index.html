<h2 id="edge-transformations-a-primer-on-fastly-s-image-optimization">Edge transformations: a primer on Fastly's image optimization</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Today, a staggering 64% of all web traffic (62% on mobile) is image content. It therefore comes as no surprise that image optimization is the number one feature request by Fastly customers. The reason for this is very simple – Image optimization and delivery come with many pain points. It can be tediously repetitive, error-prone and, due to the many moving parts of a typical image pipeline, be expensive to self-host, support and scale.</em></p>
<p><em>In this workshop we will introduce you to the many advantages of image optimization, discuss use cases, and even show you a few advanced options.</em></p>

<h2 id="creating-better-function-interfaces-in-rust">Creating Better Function Interfaces in Rust</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Rust has a powerful type system, but do you know how to create good interfaces with those types? Rust's ownership model can make it challenging to translate how a program works in your mental model to syntax that satisfies the Rust compiler. We do not need to contort our interfaces in order to satisfy the compiler. I will introduce some strategies for working with the DST/slice pattern using the <code>Into</code> trait and <code>Cow</code> enum. I will also show how lifetimes can be leveraged to create safer interfaces for resource access.</em></p>

<h2 id="rust-systems-programming-for-web-developers">Rust: Systems Programming for Web Developers</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The modern web stack is made up of a dozen different systems, but too few people know how to create and support them. I believe this is because systems programming has historically had too many barriers to entry, such as memory safety and the trading of expressiveness for performance. Let us explore some of the ways Rust breaks down these barriers and can make systems programming feel much more approachable to web developers.</em></p>

<h2 id="rust-systems-programming-for-web-developers-1">Rust: Systems Programming for Web Developers</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>This a call to action for web developers to get involved in systems programming. The modern web stack is getting more complex, but too few people know how to create and support the essential elements of that stack. I believe this is because systems programming has historically had too many barriers to entry. Modern systems languages, like Rust, are breaking down these barriers. Ever wanted to write a toy shell or create your own version of memcache? Rust makes systems programming feel much more approachable to web developers.</em></p>

<h2 id="panel-capitalizing-on-both-html5-and-native-apps-to-deliver-cost-effective-content">Panel: Capitalizing on Both HTML5 and Native Apps to Deliver Cost Effective Content</h2>
<p><strong>Panel focus:</strong> <em>Mobile in 2013 has been a year of trial and error, testing and learning. Everyone is at different stages of their mobile ‘journey’. Lets start by asking- what are the fundamentals of a ‘good’ HTML5/app strategy, based on your experience so far? Who are we catering to? Is a no brainer to have an app? The panels next main focus can be how the audience can blend both HTML5 and apps into their mobile strategy, based on what is right for them. How did you find the sweet spot? What worked for HSN? What worked for Hautelook? How can some of those best practices be actually used by the audience? Lets talk more about pros and cons of each. It would be great to have a debate too around the ‘hybrid’ concept. It seemed to work for HSN, but not for Hautelook? Why/why not? Another good focus can be Phonegap and some of the less expensive methods of implementing strategy. What are the best options available? What worked well when working with solution providers and other internal teams? We can wrap up by discussing where we are in terms of where we see value for the future. What are the challenges ahead? How is responsive design changing the playing field? Where are the opportunities? How can we each take mobile to the next level?</em></p>

<h2 id="hal-a-lean-hypermedia-type">HAL - A Lean Hypermedia Type</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The web is made up links and forms that allow people to intuitively grasp how to navigate and interact with pages. Hypermedia APIs take traditional REST APIs provide them these same affordances. Hal is a simple hypermedia format that is built on top of JSON. The Hal hypermedia type allows API authors to link representations together to create an API that is more easily consumable by the client. As more and more of the technology around is powered by APIs, it is critical that we learn how to build them in a way that allows us for versioning, backwards compatibility and flexibility.</em></p>

<h2 id="grokking-http-methods">Grokking HTTP Methods</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have probably all heard of REST. It is currently the popular way to create APIs for internal and/or external use. Virtually all RESTful API’s are built on top of HTTP. Thus, it is important to understand how the different HTTP methods work. They are key to creating a solid RESTful API and offer so much more than simple CRUD. We will be taking a deep-dive into the HTTP methods and providing some foundation for further exploration of HTTP and how it relates to RESTful APIs.</em></p>
